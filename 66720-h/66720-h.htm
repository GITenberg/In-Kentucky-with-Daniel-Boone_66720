<span class="small">THE GRAY LIZARD SPEAKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Along</span> the trail which wound along the
banks of the Yadkin, in North Carolina,
rode a tall, sinewy man; he had a bronzed,
resolute face, wore the hunting shirt, leggins
and moccasins of the backwoods, and
had hanging from one shoulder a long
flint-locked rifle. A small buck, which
this unerring weapon of the hunter had
lately brought down, lay across his saddle
bow.</p>

<p>Away along the trail, at a place where
the river bent sharply, a cloud of dust arose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
in the trail; and as the hunter rode forward
he kept his keen eyes upon this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horsemen,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;Two of
them, I reckon, judging from the dust.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer rolled the cloud; at
length the riders within it could be seen.
One was a middle-aged man who rode a
powerful black horse; the other was a boy
of perhaps thirteen whose mount was a
long-legged young horse, with a wild eye
and ears that were never still.</p>

<p>Catching sight of the hunter, the man on
the big black drew rein.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Daniel!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Well met!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Colonel Henderson?&#8221; replied
the backwoodsman. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t calculate
on seeing you to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I rode over for the express purpose of
having a talk with you,&#8221; said Colonel
Henderson. &#8220;I was at your house, but
they told me you&#8217;d gone away early this
morning to try for some game.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hunter glanced down at the buck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
across his saddle. There was a discontented
frown upon his brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, gone since early morning,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;And this is all I got. The hunting ain&#8217;t
so good in the Yadkin country as it was
once. As a boy I&#8217;ve stood in the door of
my father&#8217;s cabin and brought down deer
big enough to be this one&#8217;s granddaddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy on the long-legged horse bounced
up and down in his saddle at this; the nag
felt his excitement and began to rear and
plunge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, boy, steady,&#8221; said Colonel Henderson.
&#8220;Hold him in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, uncle,&#8221; replied the lad.
&#8220;He don&#8217;t mean anything by it.&#8221; Then
to the hunter, as his mount became quiet:
&#8220;That was good shooting, Mr. Boone, wasn&#8217;t
it? And,&#8221; pointing to the carcass of the
buck, &#8220;so was that. Right behind the
left shoulder; and it left hardly a mark
on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel Boone smiled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;I always treat my old rifle well,&#8221; said
he, humorously. &#8220;And she never goes
back on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time ago I had a talk with John
Finley,&#8221; said Colonel Henderson. &#8220;He told
me wonderful tales of the hunting country
beyond the Laurel <span class="nowrap">Ridge.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>Daniel Boone&#8217;s eyes went toward the
northwest where the great mountain chain
reared its peaks toward the sky until they
were enveloped in a blue mist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond the Laurel Ridge,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;there is a country such as no man has
ever seen before. Such hills and valleys,
such forests and streams and plains can only
be in one place in the world. And there are
deer and bear and fur animals; and buffalo
cover the plains. Also,&#8221; and a grim look
came into his face, &#8220;there are redskins!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short silence; Colonel Henderson
looked at the backwoodsman very
thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>&#8220;For some time,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it has seemed
to me that these settlements are not what
they should be. The laws enforced by
the British governor Tryon, have sown
discontent among the people. New emigrants
go to other places where there are
better laws and less taxes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel Boone nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tax gatherers, magistrates, lawyers and
such like live like aristocrats,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and the farmers and other settlers are
asked to support them. We are here in
the settlements, it seems, for no other purpose
than to give these fellows a soft living.
And they take our money and treat us like
servants. A peddler who hucksters among
the Indians is thought a better man than
the one who has cut a form out of the
wilderness with his axe.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a bitterness in the man&#8217;s tone
which seemed to please the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are a great many who feel just
as you do about it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
this very thing that I rode over to speak
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel Boone shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Signing writings and sending them to
Tryon will do no good,&#8221; said he. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
tyrant and understands nothing but oppression.&#8221;
Then in a longing tone, his
eyes on the distant hills, &#8220;I wish I were
away from the Yadkin for good and all.
No man can be free here as long as we
have public officers who think of nothing
but plunder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I said before,&#8221; said Colonel Henderson,
in a satisfied tone, &#8220;there are a great
many others who are of the same way of
thinking as you. But they have nowhere
to go; if a new country was opened for
them, they would sell their farms, pack
their goods upon their horses&#8217; backs and be
gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in the speaker&#8217;s
tone that took the attention of the
backwoodsman. His keen eyes studied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Colonel Henderson&#8217;s face; but he said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever since I heard Finley talk of the
country beyond the ridge,&#8221; said the colonel,
resuming after a moment, &#8220;I&#8217;ve felt
that such a rare region should be opened
up for settlement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; cried Daniel Boone and his
eyes began to glow.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;I&#8217;ve also felt
that it should not be done until the country
was explored further&mdash;until it had been
penetrated to its interior, until its streams
were worked out on a chart, a trail made for
the passage of emigrants and the most promising
places fixed upon for settlements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right again,&#8221; said Daniel Boone. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been in the country and so have Finley and
some others; but none of us has studied
it. To do that would take a year or more;
and to live a year so far from the settlements
a man would have to make up his
mind to troubles from the Indians.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>&#8220;The Shawnees claim it,&#8221; said the colonel.
&#8220;If it is what I want, I will buy it
from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hunting-ground for Cherokees,
Shawnees and Chickasaws,&#8221; said Boone,
and he shook his head as he spoke. &#8220;So
far as I could see, it belonged to all of them.
And it&#8217;s a fighting place; when two hunting
parties meet, the hatchet, knife and
arrow begin their work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the colonel regarded the backwoodsman
attentively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew the prospect of danger or
hard work to hold you back in anything
you wanted to do,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Boone laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always tried not to let them, I
reckon,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;This fall,&#8221; and the colonel spoke slowly,
&#8220;I am going to send an exploring party
into the northwest country; and later, if
it&#8217;s what I think it is, I&#8217;ll want a party of
trail makers and a man to treat with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Shawnees. How would you like to take
charge of this matter for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Boone sat his horse, staring
at the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean it?&#8221; he said, at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The backwoodsman held out a strong
brown hand; Colonel Henderson gripped it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you,&#8221; said Boone, in a tone of
deep satisfaction. &#8220;It&#8217;s a thing I&#8217;ve been
sort of dreaming of for years. That great
region, now given over to the Indian hunters
and wild beasts, is calling the white
man. I heard its voice as I stood among
the lonely hills, in the forests, and upon
the banks of its rivers. Once there with
their families, their plows and their horses,
their cabins built, the settler will meet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Death!&#8221; said a strange voice; and,
startled, both Boone and Colonel Henderson
turned their eyes in the direction from
which it came.</p>

<p>An Indian stood there&mdash;an ancient savage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
clad in skins upon which were painted
queer symbols. Strings of amulets, bears&#8217;
claws and the teeth of foxes and wolves
hung about him; his face was lined with
the deep wrinkles of great age, his eyes
were small, black, and glittered coldly like
those of a snake.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Gray Lizard!&#8221; said Boone, in
surprise. &#8220;Are you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Indian advanced a step or two,
supporting himself by a long staff. Keenly
the serpent eyes gazed at the three whites.</p>

<p>&#8220;Death will meet the paleface,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;He will never build his lodge in the
country beyond the mountains. Let him
once pass the great gap, and he is no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boone laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been through the gap, Gray Lizard,&#8221;
he said, good-naturedly; &#8220;and so
have other white men. And we still live.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cold eyes fixed themselves upon the
resolute face; one skinny finger was lifted
until it pointed at Boone&#8217;s breast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>&#8220;You have,&#8221; said Gray Lizard. &#8220;You
have, and you are marked. Let your rifle
once more break the silence of the hills or
ring over the waters of the red man&#8217;s rivers,
and your death song is sung.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he turned to Colonel Henderson,
and continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, white chief, take care! The
Gray Lizard has known these many moons
of what you mean to do, and now he
warns you. If you love your friends, do
not send them beyond the Laurel Ridge.
For in the wilderness their fate awaits them
at the hands of the Shawnees.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and was about to go; then he
paused, and added:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Gray Lizard is old. He has seen
many things. He knew the Yadkin when
the white man was a stranger on its banks.
Take warning by his words: do not venture
beyond the blue hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, his long staff ringing on the stones,
he went limping down the trail.</p>

<span class="small">A COMING STRUGGLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the strange figure of the old Cherokee
went halting along the river trail, the eyes
of Boone and his companions followed curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;A queer sort of customer,&#8221; commented
Colonel Henderson. &#8220;I don&#8217;t recall ever
having seen him before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a wonder worker and medicine
man,&#8221; said Boone. &#8220;And he spends a good
bit of his time on the fringe of the settlements.
Sometimes,&#8221; and here a frown came
upon his brow, &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought him more of
a spy than anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate he knows how to creep up
on one secretly,&#8221; said the colonel, with a
laugh. And then, more soberly: &#8220;And he
seemed rather earnest in his sayings.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Daniel Boone nodded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these old redskins are crafty,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;They spend their days and nights
finding out ways of imposing on their fellow
savages. And managing to do this without
trouble they think they can impose in the
same way upon the white man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Colonel Henderson.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they can put fear in the hearts of the
whites,&#8221; continued Boone, &#8220;the whites will
not venture into the wilderness. A settler
killed now and then is the common way;
but there are others, and I&#8217;ve heard a warning
spoken by a prophet hung with totems
before to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy who had been staring after the
figure of Gray Lizard now spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering where I saw him
before, and now I&#8217;ve remembered, Uncle
Dick,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Yesterday I rode up the
river to visit the camp of the young braves
who are to take part in the games. It was
there I saw him; among the lodges.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Boone; &#8220;and so the braves
have come in for the games, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than a score of them,&#8221; replied the
lad. &#8220;And a fine looking lot they are, sir,&#8221;
with admiration.</p>

<p>The backwoodsman nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are sure to be,&#8221; said he, grimly.
&#8220;The redskins seldom send any but the pick
of their villages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been three days since they pitched
their camp,&#8221; said the lad. &#8220;And they&#8217;ve
been hard at work ever since, practicing
with their bows and rifles, and throwing
their hatchets at marks. There&#8217;s a good
runner or two among them,&#8221; added the boy;
&#8220;and they have some fine horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been against these games,&#8221;
said Daniel Boone, as he shook his head.</p>

<p>Colonel Henderson looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;how is that? Athletic
games always seemed to me to be good for
the youngsters.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;So they are,&#8221; agreed Boone. &#8220;Mighty
good. But these of ours are a mistake, because
the lads don&#8217;t put enough heart in
&#8217;em. They don&#8217;t take &#8217;em serious enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all in the spirit of fun,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>But Boone shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re wrong, colonel,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and that&#8217;s where the boys are also
wrong. There ain&#8217;t many of us whites on
this border; but over beyond the Laurel
Ridge the Indians lie in clouds. And that
they haven&#8217;t blotted us out long since is
because away down in their hearts they&#8217;ve
thought we&#8217;re better&#8217;n they are, for we&#8217;ve
always showed we could give them odds and
beat them at anything they cared to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, you think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our young men are letting them pull
out ahead too often; and that&#8217;s not a good
thing to have happen. Once let the red
man get the notion that he&#8217;s better than the
white, and this border&#8217;ll be turned into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
wilderness&mdash;there won&#8217;t be a settlement but
won&#8217;t feel the tomahawk and the torch. The
white man will be turned back from the
west for twenty years to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221; Colonel Henderson looked
thoughtful. &#8220;I never thought of that,
Daniel; and now that you put it before me
I can see that you are right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy had listened to what the backwoodsman
had to say with much attention.
Now he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eph Taylor was along when I rode up
to the Shawnee camp yesterday,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;And as we went he told me how the young
braves crowed over them last fall, and how
they promised to beat them even worse this
year. And when we got to the camp all
the young warriors grinned at us and talked
a lot among themselves. Eph knows some
of their language and said it was all about
us, and about the games and how they were
going to run away from us in everything
we tried.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Boone looked at Henderson and nodded,
grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see?&#8221; said he. &#8220;That&#8217;s how it
will begin. Five years from now these
same young redskins will have a voice in
the councils of their tribe. Let them carry
this feeling of being better than us into
those councils, and nothing will hold them
back from a bloody war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Noll,&#8221; said Colonel Henderson
to his nephew, &#8220;you see what you&#8217;ve got
before you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tone was half laughing; but when
Oliver Barclay made reply it was with all
the seriousness in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eph and I talked about it as we rode
back home,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And we made up
our minds to give them a hard fight for
each match as it came along. Eph and I
are to arrange everything to-day; that&#8217;s
why I am riding over to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Colonel Henderson, &#8220;I
suppose you may as well go on if that&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
what you are about. I have some business
to talk over with Mr. Boone, and will ride
back to his farm with him. Will you be
home to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noll shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; he replied. Then
with a laugh: &#8220;When I get down to
plotting with Eph Taylor there&#8217;s no telling
when I&#8217;ll get through.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook the rein, and the long-legged
young horse brandished its heels in most
exuberant fashion. The boy waved his
hand to the two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said he. Then to Boone,
&#8220;Going to be at the games to-morrow, Mr.
Boone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said the backwoodsman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; suggested Noll. &#8220;Maybe
something&#8217;ll happen that&#8217;ll please you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boone looked at the strong young figure
sitting the fiery horse so easily, the clear
eyes, the confident smile. And his bronzed
face wrinkled in a laugh of pleasure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;Well, Noll,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go. But
mind you this: I&#8217;ll expect something more
than I saw a year ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can promise you that, anyhow,&#8221; said
the boy. &#8220;And maybe there&#8217;ll be more.
Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he rode forward along the
river trail, while Daniel Boone and Colonel
Henderson turned their horses&#8217; heads in
the opposite direction. A mile further
on Noll overtook Gray Lizard plodding on
with the help of his long staff. The magician
gave the boy a sidelong glance as he
passed; but Noll did not check the lope of
his horse, pushing on until he reached a
place where a second trail branched away
from the river, winding among the huge
forest trees and losing itself in the billowing
ocean of foliage.</p>

<p>He struck into this, and after an hour&#8217;s
riding came in sight of a well-built log
house, surrounded by broad fields, from
which the crops had lately been harvested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Before the cabin door sat a tall, lank boy
in a hunting shirt, busily engaged in cleaning
a long flint-locked rifle. At the sound of
the rapid hoof-beats he looked up. Recognizing
Oliver, who was still some distance
off, he waved his hand in greeting; then
he turned his head and spoke to some one
within the cabin.</p>

<p>Drawing rein before the door, young
Barclay threw himself from the saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Eph,&#8221; said he, as he tied his
mount to a post, &#8220;I suppose you all but
gave up hope of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eph Taylor had a long, droll looking
face, and as he shook his head he twisted
his countenance into an expression of comic
denial.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I reckoned you&#8217;d be
along some time soon. This thing of ours
was too important to let go by.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rammed a greased cloth down the
barrel of the rifle, and twisting it about,
withdrew it once more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;I saw Sandy,&#8221; added he.</p>

<p>At this Noll Barclay was all eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you!&#8221; exclaimed he. &#8220;And what
did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I let him speak for himself,&#8221;
said Eph, with the same comical twist to
his long face. &#8220;He came over this afternoon
to talk things over with us. Ho!
Sandy! Can you come here for a little?&#8221;</p>

<p>A short, tow-haired youth appeared at
the door of the cabin; he carried a halter
in one hand and a brad-awl in the other.
He nodded to Oliver good-humoredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you again,&#8221; said he. &#8220;How
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>His accent was broadly Scotch, and there
was a round-bodied heartiness to him
which at once inspired good will.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in right good health,&#8221; said Oliver.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m glad enough to see you, Sandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy Campbell laughed. He placed a
strap of the halter against the door frame
and punctured it with the awl.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;I was mighty taken with your notion,&#8221;
stated he. &#8220;And when I got done with
my work, I rode over to hear more about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliver Barclay sat down upon a rough
settle which stood beneath a cottonwood;
he looked at the other two boys with earnest
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What we talked over yesterday, Eph,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;seemed good reason enough for
us to make an attempt to get the best of the
Cherokees. But what I heard this afternoon
puts a different face on it altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eph Taylor looked up from his rifle in
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that you have
changed your mind!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Oliver shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; answered he. &#8220;Indeed,
I&#8217;m firmer about it than ever. But to just
make an attempt to best the Indians won&#8217;t
do now; we must beat them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Eph and Sandy looked at him inquiringly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>&#8220;You say you heard something,&#8221; said
Sandy Campbell. &#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I rode down the trail with my
uncle,&#8221; said Noll, &#8220;we met Mr. Boone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The face of Eph Taylor took on an expression
of interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was something he said, was it?
Well, then, I allow it was worth listening
to, for Dan&#8217;l Boone always talks as the
crow flies&mdash;in a straight line.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, while his two friends listened
with great attention, Oliver repeated the
words of the backwoodsman. When he
had finished, Sandy nodded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds much like the truth of the
matter,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the truth!&#8221; declared Eph, emphatically.
&#8220;If we give these redskins a chance
to crow over us in little things, they&#8217;ll
think they can do it in big things. To-morrow
we must take &#8217;em in hand and
give them a good thrashing&mdash;a regular good
one that they&#8217;ll not forget in a hurry.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m all ready for my part of it,&#8221; grinned
Sandy. &#8220;Or, at least I will be as soon as
this halter&#8217;s finished. That old Soldier
horse couldn&#8217;t have been better for the
work if he&#8217;d been picked out of a hundred.
He&#8217;s got a back as wide as a floor; and I&#8217;ve
been practicing with him all summer, never
thinking I&#8217;d have any use for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky you did,&#8221; spoke Eph. &#8220;And
I reckon the things you do&#8217;ll make the
redskins open their eyes. As for me,&#8221; and
he fondled the long rifle lovingly, &#8220;I got
old Jerusha here; and when she begins to
talk I allow there won&#8217;t be many Shawnees
that&#8217;ll use better language.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliver smiled and nodded. To strangers
there would have been a boastful note in
the words of young Taylor; but not to those
who knew him. The boy was a wonderful
shot at all distances, but it never occurred
to him to take any personal credit for this.
Oddly enough he gave it all to his rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody with half an eye could miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
with her,&#8221; he&#8217;d frequently declare. &#8220;She&#8217;s
the greatest old shooting iron ever made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliver sat smiling and nodding at Eph&#8217;s
faith in his piece, and while he did so his
eyes went to the spot where the long-legged
young horse was tied. Sandy noticed the
look and his glance also went in the same
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Hawk will do his share,&#8221; said he
with an air of expert judgment. &#8220;He has
speed and bottom and in a long race he&#8217;ll
break the hearts of those Indian nags.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like his master&#8217;ll break the hearts
of the Shawnees that&#8217;ll run against <i>him</i>,&#8221;
spoke Eph Taylor, with confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of that,&#8221; said Oliver;
and as he spoke a sound from across the
fields toward the line of forest took their
attention. The sinking sun glanced from
the lithe bronze body of a young Indian
who was running swiftly and low, like a
hound. &#8220;There&#8217;s the fellow I&#8217;m to fight it
out against,&#8221; added the white boy. &#8220;And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
any one who comes in ahead of him will
have speed, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eph Taylor nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s good,&#8221; admitted he. &#8220;But I
count on him, Injun like, only to use his
legs in the race. To beat him, all you&#8217;ve
got to do is to use your head as well.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="small">DANIEL BOONE, MARKSMAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mounted</span> upon his powerful bay horse,
Daniel Boone the following day rode
toward Holman&#8217;s Ford. This point was
some eight miles from Hillsboro, and it was
here that the young men of the settlement
met each fall for their hardy frontier
games.</p>

<p>Keen-sighted youths, bearing long barrelled
flint-locks, eagerly awaited this, the
test of their skill; sturdy wrestlers burned
to match their thews against each other;
and the runners, both horse and man, were
equally anxious to show their quality.</p>

<p>The sun had reached high noon when
the backwoodsman reached the ford, dismounted
and tied his nag to a tree. A
long line of wagons, the horses tied to the
wheels, stood on the river bank; the settlers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
and their families were gathered beneath
the trees. Apart from these were the athletes
of farm and forest, well-grown boys
and brawny young men; they stood about
in knots and discussed the probabilities of
each event. A smaller knot than any of
the others stood at the foot of a huge cottonwood;
a hail went up from this as Boone
went by; and he paused as he recognized
Oliver Barclay, Eph Taylor and Sandy
Campbell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, youngsters,&#8221; said the pioneer,
&#8220;how is it going?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eph Taylor grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t been much done yet, Mr.
Boone,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And even with the little
we&#8217;ve gone through, we&#8217;ve had trouble with
the redskins.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes of Boone went to a cleared space
among the trees where a number of lodges
had been erected; upon some skins, thrown
upon the ground, lay a half score of keen-looking
Shawnees. To the trees near by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
were fastened a number of rangy-looking
horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; asked the backwoodsman.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had the jumps,&#8221; said Eph, &#8220;and
none of the Indians entered for them. So
Eben Clarke won &#8217;em all. Then there was
the throwing of the stone and big Sam Dutton
put it further than any one else, by a
good bit. The first thing the Shawnees
took any interest in was the swim. It was
across the river and back, to start at the
word and all together. A slippery little
redskin entered for that; he got into the
water like a streak; and he was a real good
swimmer. George Collins was off in the
front and the little Shawnee went by him
like a fish. Then George began to stretch
out and grab the water in armfuls and
pull himself after him. But he never
caught him till they got to the middle of
the stream on the way back. Sandy here
was in the race,&#8221; and Eph grinned. &#8220;He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
thinks he&#8217;s a swimmer, but he was still on
the way over when George and the redskin
were coming back. Just as George caught
the Indian they both ran afoul of Sandy.
And because George went ahead from that
on and won the race the Shawnees say the
whole consarned thing was a put up job to
beat them out of the race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not so,&#8221; said Sandy, with indignation.
&#8220;If I interfered with anybody
it was with George Collins. I dived to get
out of the Indian&#8217;s way when I saw him
coming and I went straight into George.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one of them who understands
any English, beside old Gray Lizard,&#8221;
said Oliver, &#8220;and that&#8217;s the tall fellow
covered with the bearskin. We took the
trouble to explain the matter to them; but
they just shake their heads and candidly
think the worst of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Injuns,&#8221; stated Boone, &#8220;can never be
got to quite believe the white man. Maybe
it&#8217;s because they&#8217;ve been beaten so often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
and in so many ways that they&#8217;ve come to
think that he <i>can&#8217;t</i> have played fair with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wrestling was now going forward,
and big Sam Dutton, he of the &#8220;stone
throw,&#8221; was disposing of opponent after
opponent with ease. There being little interest
manifested in this because of its one-sidedness,
the master of ceremonies, a stout,
humorous-looking man, called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll now have the fancy riders
out getting ready.&#8221; Then in a lower tone
to those near him, &#8220;This is a thing the
Injuns always win, and our boys ought to
be ashamed of themselves for letting &#8217;em.
Trick riding ought to be as easy for a white
as a redskin.&#8221;</p>

<p>This complaint was greeted by a laugh
from those at whom it was aimed; and the
laugh was still echoing when a young
Shawnee ran out and across the green. To
a tree some distance away he affixed a mark
of painted bark, then he paced off a score of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
yards, turned, drew a tomahawk and waved
it as though in challenge. Then the sinewy,
bronzed arm went back and the hatchet
whizzed through the air; true and fair it
struck the mark, burying itself an inch or
more in the tree.</p>

<p>A yell went up from the young braves at
this; there were challenging glances thrown
right and left; but as none of the whites
appeared disposed to accept, a fresh mark
was put up. Another Shawnee stepped
forward and drew out a heavy-bladed knife.
For an instant he balanced it in his hand,
then launched it forward like a lightning
flash, straight to the heart of the mark.</p>

<p>Another whoop arose, and again the triumphant
challenging glances went around
from the young savages.</p>

<p>&#8220;They reckon there ain&#8217;t none of you got
it in you to do a thing like that,&#8221; stated the
master of ceremonies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you wait till the shooting,&#8221; answered
a voice, and a murmur went up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
from among the whites. &#8220;We&#8217;ll show &#8217;em
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you ought to,&#8221; answered the stout
man. &#8220;You&#8217;ve lived all your lives with
rifles in your hands, and it&#8217;s not much to
your credit that you can shoot. But,&#8221; and
he waved one pudgy finger at them, &#8220;don&#8217;t
be too sure of the shooting, even at that.
Maybe you ain&#8217;t heard that Long Panther
is here to-day! And anybody that&#8217;s acquainted
with that young redskin knows a
Shawnee with a good eye and a steady
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here those horsemen entered for the
fancy riding galloped out into the open
space. To a man they were Indians, in all
the bravery of paint and plumes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a single one of you!&#8221; exclaimed
the fat master of ceremonies, reproachfully,
his gaze going from the array of confident
savages to the circle of lolling young
whites. &#8220;Not a single one; not a thing do
you know about riding but to get into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
saddle and sit there like an old dame in a
rocking-chair. Not a single&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But there he paused, for just then there
rode into the open space a round-bodied
youth with a cheerful, good-natured face,
and mounted upon an ambling white horse,
as fat and unlike the fiery brutes bestridden
by the Shawnees as could well be imagined.
A roar went up at sight of this
unexpected entry; even the stoical savages
grinned in ironic enjoyment of the situation.</p>

<p>Gravely the master of ceremonies shook
the newcomer&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; said he, gratefully, &#8220;you
may not have much chance, but you have
got pluck. What&#8217;s your name and the
name of that young animal you&#8217;re a-riding?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Sandy Campbell,&#8221; replied that good-natured
youth, &#8220;and this,&#8221; patting the fat
white horse on the neck, &#8220;is Soldier, a plow
horse, fifteen years old, belonging to the
man I work for.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Another shout went up from the by-standers;
but the master of ceremonies
held up his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not your turn to laugh,&#8221; stated he.
&#8220;He&#8217;s making a try; and that&#8217;s something
more than any of you have the enterprise
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word was given; one after another
the young braves set their horses into a
gallop; when at full speed they leaped from
the backs of their mounts and, clinging to
the streaming manes, ran a dozen or more
yards by their sides; then with agile swings
they were astride them once more. Then
with a rush they approached the starting
point, bringing up sharply and in picturesque
fashion, the front hoofs of the horses
pawing the air.</p>

<p>All eyes now turned upon Sandy Campbell
and the sleek sided Soldier. Quietly
Sandy gave the white horse the word and
calmly the placid beast obeyed. At a stoical
gallop he began circling the clearing; his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
movements were as regular as those of a
rocking-horse; and Sandy sat him in total
unconcern while shouts and laughter
greeted them on every hand. Then Sandy
threw his right leg across the horse&#8217;s broad
back, sitting him sideways; it looked like
an uncouth beginning of the feat performed
by the Shawnees and a titter of expectancy
began. This changed to a roar of derision
as the fat boy slid from his perch to the
ground.</p>

<p>But if they had watched keenly, they
would have perceived that he alighted with
a soft, practiced accuracy; also that the long
comic bounds which followed at the side of
the calmly galloping Soldier were really as
light as those of a rubber ball. Then with
one higher than the others, and never putting
a hand upon his horse, he was upon its
back once more; and Soldier drew up,
switching his tail and regarding the green
distance with sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>Without waiting for the surprised applause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
of the settlers to grow to the height
it naturally would have reached, one of the
young Shawnees shook his rein; his nimble
steed darted away like the wind, an arrow
flew ahead, performed a graceful arch and
stack in the ground. Racing at full speed
the horse swooped down upon it; clinging
with one foot and one hand the brave
stooped, caught the feathered shaft, and
recovering, waved it above him triumphantly.</p>

<p>Soldier was at once put into motion;
when he had attained his best speed, Sandy&#8217;s
hat flew ahead to one side, and a long hunting
knife followed, falling to the other side,
but a dozen or more yards further along.
Heading his galloping horse between these,
Sandy stooped and caught the hat; then
recovering like a flash, he threw himself to
the opposite side, gripping the shaft of the
knife as he sped by.</p>

<p>The shout which greeted this made the
echo from across the Yadkin ring lustily;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
the settlers now awoke to the fact that the
round-faced youth and his fat plow horse
knew what they were about. And so they
eagerly acclaimed and urged them to do
their best.</p>

<p>Trick after trick of horsemanship was
performed by the Indians, and all with the
ease of experts and the dash of perfect
confidence. But their feats showed little
imagination, and in this those of the white
boy were vastly superior. Each time they
displayed something new he duplicated it
with an added touch, leaving them open-mouthed
and aghast.</p>

<p>At last one of them, and their finest rider
by far, broke from the line and called something
to Sandy, a something which was
evidently a defiance. Putting his horse to
gallop, he, with much effort, swaying and
uncertainty, got upon his feet and there
remained until he had completed the circle,
when he leaped to the ground. While the
yells of the Indians were still greeting this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
bit of daring, Sandy started Soldier once
more. With perfect ease, and greatly helped
by the beast&#8217;s broad back and its rocking-horse
motion, the boy got upon his
feet; after making a complete round, he
leaped up, turned a somersault, alighted
expertly upon the platform-like back, and
once more stood erect; then standing upon
one foot and with the other twiddling in
the air, he galloped around once more.</p>

<p>This was the last straw. The Shawnees
could not hope to outdo this, and so retired.
While the whites gathered about
Sandy and his steed, Boone turned to
Oliver and Eph.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon your friend didn&#8217;t learn them
things in Carolina,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Oliver laughed, delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;At home, in Scotland,
he was a rider in a circus; and he&#8217;s
been practicing and training the white horse
for some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends!&#8221; called the master of ceremonies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
&#8220;the time is drawing on, and as
there are three contests still to be decided,
we&#8217;d best get at them. The race for horses
is next; riders will line across the trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this summons, Oliver Barclay sprang
from Hawk, his long-legged young horse,
untied and mounted him; and as it happened
as he rode to the end of the forming
line, he found himself next the tall young
Shawnee whom they had pointed out to
Boone as being able to talk English.</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph!&#8221; said this personage, his swift
eyes running over the points of the horse.
&#8220;You ride?&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliver nodded. The young brave bestrode
a bony, long barreled horse with small ears
and a wicked head. Its bared teeth gleamed
as it snapped viciously at the horses within
reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you run,&#8221; ventured the Shawnee.
Again Oliver nodded; and a glint of satisfaction
came into the keen black eyes of the
brave.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;Heap good!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Long Panther
will beat you in both.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliver smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Long Panther is a good rider,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;We have seen him many times break
the wild horse, and manage the swift one.
And he can run. Only yesterday I saw
him flying along the trail like a wolf in the
track of an antelope. But,&#8221; and the boy
shook his head, &#8220;to win to-day, even Long
Panther must do his best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;White boy shoot?&#8221; asked Long Panther;
but Oliver shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not enough to match myself against
experts,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But there are a few
who will handle the rifle to-day, Long
Panther, whom it will not be easy to draw
away from.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Shawnee lifted his head proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The red man will win,&#8221; said he. &#8220;His
eye is like the eagle&#8217;s, his hand as steady
as the head of a rattlesnake before it
strikes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>The glance of the master of ceremonies
ran along the line of horsemen. Then he
pointed to a lone tree far down the river
trail from which a flag was flying.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ride to that, around it, and back,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;And now, when I drop my hat,
you start.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the glance went along the line
to assure him that all was still as it should
be. Then the hat fell.</p>

<p>With a rush the horses shot forward
along the trail; a cloud of dust overhung
them and it was hard to tell who led or
who trailed in the rear. Then little by
little the compactness of the mass was lost;
the runners began to stretch out, the swift
going to the front, and the others falling
back. At the flag the dust ascended in a
great column; then the riders were seen
plunging through it on the way to the
finish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Long Panther in the lead!&#8221; cried Eph
Taylor, straining his eyes to make out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
contestants. &#8220;And he&#8217;s riding like as if
he was part of the horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything of young Noll,&#8221;
said Boone.</p>

<p>Sandy Campbell was trying to keep the
sun out of his eyes by holding his outspread
hands over them; he searched the dusty
cloud as it rolled toward them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see him!&#8221; he shouted, in high excitement.
&#8220;I see him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; demanded Eph, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s about the sixth rider&mdash;far back in
the dust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixth!&#8221; cried Eph, and his voice was
husky with disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s coming along swiftly,&#8221; said
Sandy. &#8220;The Hawk is stretching over the
ground like a rabbit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see him now!&#8221; shouted Eph. &#8220;I see
him! But he&#8217;s not sixth&mdash;he&#8217;s fourth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s passed two of them since I spoke,&#8221;
said Sandy, and then with a whoop, &#8220;There
goes another to the rear!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>&#8220;And still another!&#8221; cried Eph, dropping
his beloved Jerusha and waving his
long arms. &#8220;He&#8217;s second!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see Long Panther look over his
shoulder?&#8221; called Sandy. &#8220;See how his
teeth show&mdash;even at that distance! He
looks as vicious as that ugly brute of a
horse of his.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whirling out of the dust came the bony
steed ridden by the Shawnee; its sweeping
stride covered the ground with astonishing
speed, its rider was bent low over its neck,
his eagle plumes mingling with the steed&#8217;s
flying mane. But if the stride of the
Indian&#8217;s steed ate up the distance, the long
legs of Hawk devoured it. The eyes of the
young animal fairly flowed with excitement;
his wide nostrils showed red; his flying
hoofs made dazzling play as they flashed
and reflashed, in and out, up and down;
his sleek hide was flecked with foam.</p>

<p>&#8220;One hundred yards to go!&#8221; cried
Sandy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>&#8220;And the Hawk&#8217;s nose is at the Injun&#8217;s
knee!&#8221; shouted Eph Taylor, arms still waving
madly.</p>

<p>Lower and still lower bent Long Panther,
whiter and whiter gleamed his teeth; faster
and still faster flew the thundering hoofs
of the wicked looking steed. But nothing
on four feet could have outstepped the rush
of the flame-eyed Hawk; no one who ever
sat in a saddle could have outdone in determination
the boy who bestrode him. In
a half dozen mighty bounds the Hawk was
nose and nose with the horse of the Indian;
and then he was ahead, daylight showing
between them true and fair; when he
flashed by the finish he was a winner by a
good half dozen yards.</p>

<p>White boy and red slipped from their
horses almost side by side as the roar of
applause went up from the crowd. Leaning
against the heaving side of his mount,
the Long Panther stood for a moment staring
into the face of Oliver Barclay. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
without a word, he turned, leaving his
horse standing in the trail and strode
toward the lodges among the trees.</p>

<p>Amid the tumult of shouting the stout
master of ceremonies was not idle. The
next event was the shooting at all distances&mdash;and
with all weapons; and the targets
and marks were set up with all possible
speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, friends,&#8221; cried the stout man at the
top of his voice, addressing a throng gathered
about Oliver and the Hawk, &#8220;I know
how you feel, for I feel just that way myself.
It&#8217;s a good boy and a good colt. But
let&#8217;s get ahead with things. Now we have
the shooting on our hands&mdash;shooting with
rifles or with bows and arrows, the white
man and his red brother to have the use of
his favorite weapon. If a white wants to
use a bow, let him do so and the fates
prosper him; if a red prefers a rifle, let
him take it by all means and use it to the
best of his courage and eyesight.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>As the riflemen came forward, each with
his long weapon in his grip, the throng followed
and formed a sort of half circle behind
them. Several of the Indians also advanced,
their long bows tautly strung, their
quivers full of arrows.</p>

<p>One by one the rifles cracked, and the
bowstrings sang; mark after mark was
shot away, and marksman after marksman
fell back defeated. Eph Taylor advanced
time after time, Jerusha in his hand; fondly
he&#8217;d cuddle the smooth stock against his
cheek, and when the old weapon&#8217;s sharp
voice rang out, it was to announce the
planting of a bullet in the heart of the
target.</p>

<p>After three-quarters of an hour the last
Shawnee was eliminated; and the struggle
seemed between Eph Taylor and a gray-haired,
keen-eyed hunter from the region
toward the ridge. It was nip and tuck between
this pair; neither seemed able to
perform a feat which the other could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
duplicate. The ringing of the shots, the
spatting of the ball, the fall of wand or
coin, or the snuffing out of candles went on
with monotonous regularity; but at length
this was broken by the appearance of the
magician, Gray Lizard. With his amulets
of skulls and claws, and pouches filled with
potent charms hanging from him, his staff
in his hand and his ratty old eyes filled
with contempt, he advanced to the place
where the riflemen were standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What child&#8217;s work!&#8221; cried he. &#8220;What
pastime for the papooses of the village!
Again and again do you repeat what you
have done before. And nothing comes of it.
The Shawnee is about to go! but before he
goes he would like to show his white brother
what he thinks is a real test of skill.&#8221; Then
to the master of ceremonies, &#8220;Is it the
white man&#8217;s will?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stout official scratched his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s against all the rules that I ever
heard tell of,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;But I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
for letting them do it. What do you say,
lads?&#8221;</p>

<p>A shout of assent went up from the settlers;
for all were eager to see what the
redskin marksman would do.</p>

<p>The Gray Lizard turned and held up one
hand toward the little knot of savages who
stood in a gloomy array at one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Long Panther, by jickety!&#8221; said Eph,
who had been looking toward the Indians,
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought he was so tarnal mad at being
licked in the hoss race that he didn&#8217;t mean
to shoot at all,&#8221; said the old hunter who
had been pressing Eph close. &#8220;But here
he comes, as proud as a she wolf with
seven pups, and a-meaning to outshoot
all creation if it can be done any way at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Long Panther advanced with erect head
and a face like bronze, so utterly devoid of
expression was it; but his keen swift eyes
were full of fire and insolent challenge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
His manner was that of one who felt himself
master of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Gray Lizard spoke well,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;To shoot at sticks and lights is work for
the papoose, and not for the warrior. I ask
but one shot; and then let any of you do as
well, and I am content to say the white
man is better than the Shawnee.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke his swift eyes went about
among the trees; upon a huge dead limb
of an oak, near to the trunk, sat a gray
squirrel, his bushy tail held erect, his deft
forepaws stroking his moustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;A live mark!&#8221; said Long Panther, as
he fitted an arrow to his string. &#8220;I will
take it through the skin at the back of its
neck and pin it to the tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost before he ceased to speak, the
arrow flew upon its mission; and the next
instant the squirrel, pinned exactly as the
Shawnee marksman had said, was struggling
for release.</p>

<p>A hush fell upon the crowd; and as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
boy nimbly ascended the oak and liberated
the squirrel, the master of ceremonies spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men, it was a good shot. And, now,
speak up. Can any of you do the like?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eph and the old hunter were shaking
their heads when Daniel Boone stepped
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;The brave,&#8221; said Boone, slowly, &#8220;has
made a good shot. No one will gainsay
that. But it was a trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>All eyes were upon him; Long Panther
gave him a look of fierce disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;The shot,&#8221; said the young warrior, &#8220;was
fair, and was seen by all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boone nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But for all that it was a trick,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;It was a shot that can be made only
with an arrow. A marksman can&#8217;t pin a
squirrel to a tree trunk with a rifle bullet,
Long Panther, as you know very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur went up from the whites;
there was an eager assent to this way of
looking at the matter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>&#8220;But,&#8221; continued Boone, coolly, &#8220;you
said that if any of us could do as well, you&#8217;d
admit yourself beaten.&#8221; He balanced his
heavy rifle in his strong hands, a smile
upon his bronzed face. &#8220;Very well. To
equal your trick shot which cannot be
done with a rifle, I will do one which can&#8217;t
be done with an arrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>A huge gum tree reared its mighty head
upon the river bank; upon a limb part
way up lay a red squirrel, blinking at the
assemblage with his shrewd little eyes.
The heavy rifle began to lift toward this
mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Long Panther,&#8221; said Boone, quietly,
his eyes never leaving the tiny ball of red
fur so high in the air, &#8220;if I bring down the
little beast, dead, and with never a mark of
the bullet on him, will you admit it as good
a shot as your own?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; cried the Shawnee, promptly.</p>

<p>The long rifle cracked, a shower of particles
of bark flew up from the limb directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
under the squirrel; the concussion threw
the little animal whirling into the air; it
fell to the ground at the foot of the gum
<span class="nowrap">tree&mdash;dead.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>In an instant it was in the hands of
Long Panther; his swift eyes searched it
for the sign that would give him victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Boone, after a moment.</p>

<p>The young warrior lifted his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is without a mark,&#8221; said he. Then
as he turned away, he added in a voice of
wonder, &#8220;The white man is indeed a
mighty hunter.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the foot-racers took their
places a few moments later to decide the
question of speed and endurance, Oliver
Barclay was one of them. But there were
no Indians among them. Curiously, the
boy cast his eyes about, the words of the
Gray Lizard occurring to him. Sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
enough, there were the redskins mounted,
their camp equipment upon the backs of
the packhorses. With no thought of triumphing
over a beaten foe, but filled with
disappointment at not having the chance
to try himself against the famed runner,
Oliver stepped aside to Long Panther&#8217;s
horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! are you going before the race is
run?&#8221; asked he, astonished.</p>

<p>The young warrior looked down into
the face of the white boy long and intently;
then he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the time
will come when you and I will run a race.
And if it should, see to it that you are as
swift as the antelope of the plains; for it
may be that you will have much at stake.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that Long Panther rode off
along the trail after his fellow braves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going on a big hunt,&#8221; said one of the
settlers to another. &#8220;Taking John Finley,
who some years ago led a party to the
Louisa <span class="nowrap">River<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> region, and some others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Means to stay for some time, too, I
hear,&#8221; said the other.</p>

<p>The first speaker nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dan&#8217;l&#8217;s boys are big enough to look
after things now,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And I guess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
they have money enough to last a while.
And besides the fun of the hunt, Boone&#8217;ll
bring back rich furs, for they say the
country he&#8217;s going into just swarms with
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>But that Boone had any thought other
than hunting was not known to the settlements;
that Colonel Henderson contemplated
having the backwoodsman inspect
the wilderness as a preliminary to planting
colonies therein was kept a close secret.</p>

<p>It was one fine day in May in the year
1769 that the little party assembled for the
start. Besides Boone and Finley, there
were James Moncey, John Stuart, William
Cool and Joseph Holden, hardy woodsmen,
dead shots and men who could be depended
upon in any emergency.</p>

<p>Besides the sinewy, deep-winded horses
which they rode, they had a number of
pack animals laden with blankets, ammunition
and camp equipment and provisions.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need not take much food,&#8221; said
Boone, and Finley had agreed with him.
&#8220;A little meal and salt and such like,
that&#8217;s all. For the country into which
we&#8217;re going, boys, is a paradise for riflemen.
The streams have never been fished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
except by the wandering Injuns; the herds
of deer and buffalo are endless; the small
game, both furred and feathered, are not to
be counted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each of the adventurers had slung across
his back the very long, flint-lock rifle made
famous by their breed and generation; they
also carried keen, heavy knives and hatchets;
only a few pistols were to be seen
among them. They wore deerskin hunting
shirts and tanned leggins of the same
material; their powder-horns and bullet-pouches
swung from their shoulders.</p>

<p>Boone and the others had said good-bye
to their families and now sat their horses
in the trail along the Yadkin, having a last
word with Colonel Henderson, who had
ridden from Hillsboro to see them off.
Noll Barclay had borne him company, and
Eph Taylor, eager and curious, had journeyed
from the forest-encircled farm to
hear the latest word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; Oliver said to his uncle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
&#8220;that you have reasons, but I can&#8217;t see
why Eph and I could not ride with Mr.
Boone on this adventure as well as not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too young,&#8221; spoke the colonel,
after the fashion of a man who had heard
the suggestion in many forms before.</p>

<p>Boone looked at the straight, slight form
of the lad, and then at the lanky Eph. He
nodded his agreement with the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too young,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There are times,
lads, when years count, and this is one of
them. It&#8217;s not only your being short of
endurance but of judgment that makes it
impossible to take you along this time. You
look at this thing as a bit of fun, and that
is just what it is not. In a year or two,
though,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you&#8217;ll both have
picked up years and experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in a year or two,&#8221; objected Noll,
&#8220;there may be no trips into the wilderness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Boone and Colonel Henderson
laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>&#8220;The wilderness will be there for many
years to come,&#8221; spoke the colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this, I think, is not the last trip
into it by many,&#8221; said Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>Young Barclay had talked over the adventure
of the wilderness with both Eph
and Sandy, and while none of them hoped
to be taken along on the expedition, they,
like every lad for miles around, longed to
have fate play an unexpected prank in
their behalf.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect anything to happen,&#8221;
Oliver had said, fervently. &#8220;But you can
never tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, it did not happen, and the two
boys watched the hardy band ride along
the trail for the river, leading their pack
animals, and plunge into the budding green
sea of the forest.</p>

<p>Now began the long hardship of the
journey across the mountains. For some
days the going was not so difficult, because
ways had been hewn in the forests by settlers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
tilling the land round about; but in a
little while they penetrated beyond the
settled district and were voyaging in the
trackless wilderness where the foot of the
white man had seldom fallen. They now
followed the winding paths made by buffalo
and other large animals as being attended
with less labor than pushing their way
through the dense undergrowth and interlacing
vines. Through deep ravines, down
roaring mountain streams, descending into
wonderful valleys, fording deep rivers, they
held their way across the mountain ridge
which streaked so blue across the sky-line;
and at length they found themselves on the
verge of that far country of which they had
been in search.</p>

<p>Here and there in the journey they had
come across the tracks of redskins; once
across the tree tops they had seen tall, pale
columns of smoke lifting, which told of a
camp of some size. And having no desire
to become better acquainted with the wandering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
tribesmen, they had always changed
their course and brought into play all those
wiles known to the students of woodcraft
to throw off their trail any one who might
stumble upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always best to be careful,&#8221; said
Boone, during one of these sudden shifts in
their course. &#8220;As far as I know there&#8217;s no
big party in this region, because it belongs
to no one tribe and is visited only by the
hunters. But never take a chance that can
be avoided&mdash;that&#8217;s the safe course to follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, as Daniel Boone had said to
Colonel Henderson, the beautiful land of
Kentucky was used, from time to time, as
something more than a hunting-ground.
Bands of Chickasaws, Shawnees and Cherokees
frequently met in the heart of the
wild, and when they did, savage fighting
followed. So desperate were these conflicts
that the region became known by an Indian
name signifying &#8220;dark and bloody ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the band of white men, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
stood upon an eminence of the ridge on the
day they first sighted Kentucky, was a vast
rolling country, roamed by herds of horned
beasts, splendid streams and valleys which
promised a rich yield to the hand which
drove the plow through it.</p>

<p>But after a space given to wonder and
admiration, Boone noted that the sun was
slipping little by little behind the green
rim of the forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, boys,&#8221; suggested he, &#8220;we&#8217;d
better look for a likely place to camp for
the night. To-morrow we&#8217;ll plunge into
the new country and have a close-at-hand
look at everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the mountain-side was a small gorge
across which a cottonwood had fallen and
hidden by a dense growth of thicket. Limbs
were cut by hatchet and knife and placed
against the fallen tree in such a manner as
to form a sort of roof. Bark was pulled
from those trees which gave it readily, and
fitted over the limbs; soft balsam boughs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
were placed in the bottom of the gorge for
beds; and here the adventurers made a
home in the wilds which they kept until
the winter came with its snow and rigors.</p>

<p>A turkey was roasted above the coals,
impaled upon a ramrod; flap-jacks were
baked upon heated stones, and full of the
spirit of the thing and gifted with wonderful
appetites the adventurers fell to and
made a hearty meal.</p>

<p>Then, afterward, they stretched out upon
the soft boughs and watched the moon drift
across the sky while they talked of what
was to come. All was peace; save for the
cry of some night bird, or the stirring of the
breeze among the trees, there was no sound.</p>

<p>Then, without a word of warning, there
was a sudden crash from the black looming
forest, and the ring of a rifle-shot went
echoing and re&euml;choing from level to level
until it died away in the stillness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<span class="small">CAPTURED BY THE SHAWNEES</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the ring of the rifle died away, the
little band in the hut reached for their fire-arms;
with pieces cocked and ready, they
stole out and crouched close to the ground,
silently waiting. But nothing followed;
whoever fired the shot was a long distance
away and the firing of the shot had nothing
to do with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may have been a signal,&#8221; said Boone,
as he arose on one knee, his keen eyes
searching the great shafts of gray moonlight
which lay trailing on the mountain-side.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s not likely. If we&#8217;ve enemies
hereabouts they&#8217;d not take that way
of getting news of us to each other. For
one thing, we&#8217;d hear it; for another, powder
is a hard thing for a redskin to get, at best,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
and I reckon they&#8217;re not in a hurry to
waste any of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must have been a shot by some red
hunter to stop a catamount that had come
to his camp,&#8221; said Finley. &#8220;This looks to
be a likely country for critters of that
kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shot, so surprising and unexpected,
formed a subject for conversation during
the remainder of the evening; then, posting
a guard outside the hut, the explorers
rolled themselves in their blankets and
went quietly to sleep.</p>

<p>After a breakfast of broiled squirrel next
morning, Boone, Finley and Stuart started
out, their muskets across their shoulders, to
examine the aspect of the surrounding
country. If what they had come through
in crossing the ridge had seemed trackless,
this was infinitely more so; there were
myriads of small animals and birds; the
deer seemed merely wondering and possessed
no fear of them. Near by was one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
northern branches of the Louisa, and this
they followed for miles; each day was
given to a venture, during the entire summer
and the ensuing fall. Always some of
the party remained at the hut in the gorge,
while the others took the buffalo paths in
search of new discoveries.</p>

<p>November came with its chilly nights;
then fell December with its sudden frosts,
its flurries of snow and its long nights;
and it was in that same month of December
that the first mishap befell them.</p>

<p>It was but a few days before Christmas
that Boone and Stuart started off in a direction
seldom taken on former occasions.
There was a light snow upon the ground&mdash;not
enough to impede their progress&mdash;but
sufficient to plainly show the tracks of anything
that had passed that way. The timber
wolves had grown especially numerous
since the winter had set in, and their
prints were scattered all about in the cane-brakes
and through the woods. Once they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
came upon the clear trace of a catamount,
and nothing would have pleased them better
than to have followed the beast and
tried their rifles upon it; however, they
were in the wilderness for more important
things than mere hunting, so they passed
the tempting trail and pushed on, intent
upon the lay of the ground, the quality of
the soil, the timber and the natural drainage.</p>

<p>They had gone on for some hours in this
way when Stuart heard Boone, who was
some yards in advance, give an exclamation
of surprise. The backwoodsman had
paused and was bending over, studying
something intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Stuart, as he hastened
forward.</p>

<p>Silently Boone pointed at the snow;
there, distinctly printed, was the trail of
many moccasined feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Injuns!&#8221; said Stuart, astonished.</p>

<p>Strange as it might seem, the little band<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
of adventurers had not caught sight of a
red man since they had started out in the
previous spring; and this had, somehow,
caused the idea to grow among them that
this particular region was being avoided by
the Indian hunting parties, at any rate for
the time being.</p>

<p>Closely Boone studied the trail; some
peculiarity of the moccasin imprints struck
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are Shawnees,&#8221; said he; &#8220;and as
far as I can make out, there must be a score
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That many, at least,&#8221; spoke Stuart, his
eyes also examining the trail. &#8220;A hunting
party pushing toward the river; maybe in
search of fur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boone nodded, but somewhat dubiously.
The sudden appearance of a large band of
savages at that precise time disquieted him;
he felt in it the promise of future danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_001.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">CLOSELY BOONE STUDIED THE TRAIL</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve found meat scarce, I suppose,&#8221;
suggested Stuart, as they went on through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the forest, &#8220;and so they had to go farther
away from home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have pleased me just as well
if they&#8217;d taken another direction, then,&#8221;
said Boone. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting on too well
with our work to be disturbed just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ahead was a dense clump of dark, gloomy
pine woods, on the edge of which was a
fringe of dwarf oaks. A heavy growth of
bush and climbing thorns had sprung up
among these last; and as the two whites
came to this, their long rifles in the hollow
of their arms, there came a sudden rush, a
fierce yell of exultation, and they found
themselves borne to the ground, disarmed
and bound with leather thongs.</p>

<p>With their rifles, hatchets and hunting
knives in the possession of their captors,
and their hands firmly secured behind
their backs, they were permitted to rise,
and found themselves looking into a circle
of grim, copper-colored faces, and being examined
by narrow, threatening eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>It was a party of Shawnees, and evidently
the same whose tracks they had
come across a short time before. The
braves were in their full panoply of war;
they carried bows and scalping knives,
quivers of arrows were on their backs,
tomahawks were in their belts; a few
ancient looking rifles were the only fire-arms
to be seen among them, however, and
the powder-horns and bullet-pouches were
fewer still.</p>

<p>A powerful looking savage, evidently a
chief, and the leader of the band, now
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;The white faces hunt in the hunting-grounds
of the Shawnee,&#8221; said he, in very
bad English.</p>

<p>But Boone looked at him with cool,
humorous eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;The great chief is mistaken,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;The white man would not so wrong his
red brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Shawnee chief said something to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
followers, no doubt interpreting the saying
of the backwoodsman; there came a series
of grunts and ejaculations from them;
their copper-colored faces grew grimmer
still, their eyes even more threatening than
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday we heard the rifle of the
white face,&#8221; spoke the Shawnee leader,
turning again to Boone; &#8220;to-day we have
heard it. We have seen the remains of
deer and buffalo which he has killed; we
have seen his beaver traps in the streams.&#8221;
There was a moment&#8217;s pause, then the savage
added: &#8220;What has the white face to
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have heard our rifles speak
for many days, if you had been here,&#8221; replied
Boone. &#8220;And that you have seen
the carcasses of deer and other animals
which we have killed is quite likely. But
what of that? The country is open to
hunters, is it not? Do not the Chickasaws
and the Cherokees hunt their meat and fur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
in these woods and mountains? Why, then,
do the Shawnees claim it as their own?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chickasaws and the Cherokees are
thieves!&#8221; pronounced the Shawnee chief.
&#8220;We have taken the war-path against them;
we will make a wailing in their lodges, an
emptiness in their villages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You treat your white brother with injustice
when you ambush him and take
away his arms. You have suffered no
wrong at his hands,&#8221; maintained Boone.</p>

<p>Again the chief translated to his braves,
and again came the grunts and ejaculations.
But in spite of the threatening looks and
the tightening of the savage circle, the
backwoodsman proceeded fearlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If any one hunts in this region without
right, it is the red man,&#8221; declared he.
&#8220;The whole of the country below the great
river belongs to the white face. Many
moons ago, at the great council at Fort
Stanwix, the league of the Iroquois turned
over this land to the colonists. Does the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
red brother deny this? Does he not mean
to keep faith?&#8221;</p>

<p>What Boone said was true, and the
Shawnee knew it, but in the southern
tribes the right of the league to cede the
territory had always been denied. So the
chief regarded Boone with fierce-eyed
anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;The white face is as cunning as the
snake,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and his tongue is as
crooked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then turning away from them he gave a
signal; the band at once started off, the
two captives in their midst, guarded by a
half dozen lean, hawk-like braves. Some
miles away among the hills was the
Shawnee camp, a dozen or more deerskin
lodges erected in a sheltered place. Fires
were burning outside the tepees; several
young men were cooking strips of meat
upon pointed sticks.</p>

<p>The whites were bound to heavy stakes
driven firmly into the ground; then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
band gathered about the fires, and when the
meat was cooked began to eat it in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Stuart, who had said very
little since their capture, &#8220;it has a bad
look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be worse,&#8221; replied Boone,
coolly, his calm eyes studying the Shawnees
at the camp-fires. &#8220;There is a good
chance for us yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>Boone nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221;</p>

<p>The calm eyes twinkled as they turned
upon the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t offer me any puzzles to answer,&#8221;
said Boone. &#8220;I have no more notion &#8216;how&#8217;
than you have. But the chance will come
in some way; and it will be for us to be
ready to take hold of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though Boone had never been taken captive
by the Indians before, he knew, from
talks with those who had, and from his
knowledge of savage ceremony, that in cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
like their own, a certain form was always
gone through before torture and death were
resorted to.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll keep us,&#8221; he told Stuart, &#8220;and
try to get us to come into the tribe. It&#8217;s a
strange kink in their natures that though
they hate the white, they seldom fail to
try to make him one of them by adoption
if they have the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think they&#8217;ll try and make Shawnees
of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like as not,&#8221; answered Boone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I&#8217;ll be a renegade, I&#8217;ll die,&#8221; said
Stuart, stoutly.</p>

<p>Boone nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as I blame you in that,&#8221;
spoke he. &#8220;A renegade is as mean a critter
as walks the earth. But it&#8217;d be just as well
if we kept our feelings on that point from
the Shawnees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That if we&#8217;re asked to join the tribe,
we&#8217;d better not refuse. It&#8217;s life if we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
deceive them, and death by horrible torture
if we refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the notion of even seeming
to be an Injun,&#8221; spoke Stuart, who was a
brave man and stubborn in his courage.
&#8220;But whatever you think best, that I will
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night they were given a couple of
bearskins to lie upon, and their bonds were
looked to with much care. They slept
fairly well but were awake at dawn when
the savages began to stir about the camp.
Some meat and a sort of porridge made of
Indian corn, crushed between two smooth
stones, was given to them; and after they
had eaten, the Shawnee chief approached,
followed by the eldest of his warriors. Silently
they sat before their prisoners, seeming
to study them with the utmost attention.
After a space the chief spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;The white faces are prisoners; they were
taken in war by Black Wolf and his braves;
they are without arms, they are helpless.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Neither Stuart nor Boone made any reply
to this; but the warriors, upon the words
of Black Wolf being interpreted to them, expressed
their approval by nods and throaty
murmurs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Far away, toward the rising sun, are the
friends of the white face, far away where the
morning first touches the forest are his
lodges. Neither friends nor lodges will he
ever see again.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another pause; Black Wolf
studied the expressions of their faces intently.
But still they made no reply. The
chief then resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have killed in the hunting-grounds
of the Shawnees, and for this your lives belong
to Black Wolf and his braves. But
the chief would spare you; he does not wish
to see you die. Rather would he see you,
his brothers, living in the wigwams of the
Shawnees and taking to the war-path against
his people&#8217;s foes.&#8221;</p>

<p>This being repeated in the Shawnee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
tongue to the elder warriors, was greeted
with a chorus of approving grunts. And
then Black Wolf asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What does the white face say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Shawnee chief is a noble hunter
and a warrior whose fame runs beyond the
blue ridge,&#8221; said Daniel Boone. &#8220;And his
words are as straight as the young birch by
the waterside. It is true that the pale-face&#8217;s
friends are far away, and that his
lodge is many days across the hills; and
for both of these his heart is sore. But he
would not lose his life. Other friends he
can make; other lodges he can build; but
he has one life only, and when that is gone
he cannot call it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black Wolf repeated this to his counselors
and again came the chorus of grunted
approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well spoken,&#8221; praised the Shawnee
chief. &#8220;Do you, then, give up your people
and will you go to the villages of the
Shawnee and make them your home?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;To save my life&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; asked Black Wolf, his eyes
going to Stuart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say the same,&#8221; replied that worthy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; said the chief.</p>

<p>He arose, and the elder braves did likewise;
turning to them he spoke briefly
and to what he said they apparently
agreed with readiness. One of the warriors
took out his knife, approached the
captives and severed the thongs which
bound them.</p>

<p>Black Wolf signed for them to get up.</p>

<p>&#8220;My young men are about to start upon
a hunt,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It were well if the
white brothers went with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hunting party was already making
ready; and in half an hour or so it filed
out of the camp and along a buffalo track
which led toward the west. The two white
men trudged along the track, Boone whistling
a snatch of an old English air, Stuart
morose and heavy of brow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>Finally the latter spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are we taken out with a hunting
party and provided with no weapons? It
hasn&#8217;t a reasonable look!&#8221;</p>

<p>Boone stopped his whistling.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole idea of this party is just a
little game of the redskins. It&#8217;s not their
purpose to hunt,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not their purpose to hunt?&#8221; echoed
the other.</p>

<p>Boone nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just keep your eye peeled,&#8221; spoke he.
&#8220;Do you see how the varmints go along&mdash;careless
and never noticing us? Never a
look do they give us, so far as I can see.
But,&#8221; and he covertly clutched his companion&#8217;s
arm in his strong grip, &#8220;they&#8217;re
noticing us, never fear. They see everything
we do, every look we give away from
the track we&#8217;re following. This is not a
hunt, comrade; it&#8217;s a test of our intentions.
They are trying us. And the trial will go
on in different ways for days. Some one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
will always be watching us; to try and
escape will mean death for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pleasant outlook,&#8221; said Stuart,
gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t forget,&#8221; said Boone, &#8220;that
this watch upon us will not last always.
Let us make it seem as if we were contented
enough. If they lay little traps for
us to fall into, let us step over them. No
matter how good the chance seems for a
while, we must not try to get away; for it
will only win us a dozen or so arrows in
our backs. After a little while they&#8217;ll grow
slack in their watching. If they see us
living quietly as they live, doing the things
they do, they&#8217;ll come to trust us more and
more. And then our chance will come&mdash;and
we&#8217;ll make the best of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keeping up an intent observation of the
savages, Stuart gradually came to the conclusion
that what Boone said was true.
Not a moment passed but they found themselves
closely watched by the Shawnees.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
And so he came to see that his friend&#8217;s plan
was the solution of their situation. The
gloomy look vanished and the frowns followed;
his manner grew as care-free as
could well be imagined; he also whistled
a catch now and then; and more than once
he laughed light-heartedly over some small
incident of the march, a thing which was
not thrown away upon their red brothers.</p>

<p>That night they spent in a lodge which
Black Wolf gave up to them; as before,
they were not bound and apparently were
unguarded. But both knew that the sharp
eyes of the bronze warriors were peering at
the lodge, that lurking forms hung silently
in the shadows, and swift-winged arrows
were ready to sing their death song should
they make an attempt to escape.</p>

<p>And so it went one day after another until
a full week had passed. Adventure
after adventure did the Shawnees take
them upon; at times they were left apparently
alone for hours in the forest; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
temptation was great, but they conquered
it; and always were they glad they had
done so, for it was shown afterward that in
each case the savages had been at no great
distance, and that the thing had been one of
the traps which Boone had foretold.</p>

<p>Little by little, in the face of this plainly
shown content of the white brothers for
their lot, the Shawnees became lax in their
vigilance, and finally upon the seventh
night of their captivity, the active-minded
Boone saw their first real chance of escape.
All was still in the redskin camp; the fires
smouldered under coverings of ash; a pale,
wintry moon looked down upon the wilderness.
It had been an active day for the
savages; it had been thought that a party
of Cherokees had entered the region, and all
the warriors of Black Wolf&#8217;s band had been
ranging the woods searching for their trail.
And so these braves, whose duty it was to
keep a careful eye upon the adopted whites,
grew heavy eyed as the night wore on;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
their deep breathing told the wide-awake
Boone that all were asleep.</p>

<p>Stuart, also, was asleep; carefully Boone
awoke him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The time&#8217;s come,&#8221; he whispered in
the ear of the surprised backwoodsman.
&#8220;Make no noise; all the critters are as
sound as rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Softly they crept through the opening in
the lodge; like cats they moved among the
other wigwams until they gained the shadows.
Then Boone halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now?&#8221; asked Stuart, in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve left our rifles behind. Wait
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to go back!&#8221; Stuart
was amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must. Do you realize what it would
mean to be away here in the wilderness
without the means of getting game for food?
Man, we&#8217;d die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing the force of this, Stuart released<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the hold he had taken upon Boone&#8217;s shoulder.
Back into the Indian encampment
stole Daniel Boone; straight to the tepee of
Black Wolf he went, and, from his place in
the shadows, Stuart saw the brave pioneer
stoop and enter. Then followed a long
pause. The waiting man could hear the
heavy throbs of his own heart. Each moment
he expected to hear the war-whoop
of the Shawnee, and to see the camp spring
into activity.</p>

<p>But fortune smiled upon the daring
Boone, for after a time he appeared, the
two rifles in his hands, and their powder-horns
and bullet-pouches slung upon his
shoulders. Silently he recrossed into the
shadows; quietly he gave Stuart his own
piece, his own horn and pouch; then creeping
like wild things of the wilderness, they
stole away into the depths where the night
would hide them from all hostile eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<span class="small">BOONE IN THE WILDERNESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> that night the two adventurers
pressed steadily away from the Indian encampment;
they made, as far as they could
reckon it, in the general direction of their
camp in the gorge. The pale moon filtered
through the bare branches of the trees, the
stars twinkled helpfully; and when morning
came dimly above the higher hills they
found that they had judged their direction
with singular accuracy. They were not
more than a mile or two from their own
camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty good, for going it blind,&#8221; said
Boone, well pleased. &#8220;And now I suppose
we&#8217;ll give the boys a surprise. Having been
missing for all this time they&#8217;ll reckon
we&#8217;re gone for good.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was themselves who received the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
surprise; arriving in sight of the gorge they
saw no friendly morning smoke; hurrying
forward they entered the hut; no one was
there; everything of any value was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Injuns!&#8221; cried Boone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or they somehow heard about us being
taken by the redskins, and have gone back
to the settlements,&#8221; said Stuart.</p>

<p>Just what happened at the camp during
the seven days&#8217; captivity of Boone and Stuart
among the Shawnees has never been
written. There is no record in the annals
of the time that they returned to civilization;
the confusion of the camp as found
by Boone might have meant that it had
been deserted hastily, or that the party
therein had been murdered and robbed.
But which was the truth he probably never
knew.</p>

<p>For some time the two hardy adventurers
remained staring at the remains of the shelter
which had been their home for more
than a half year.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Boone, &#8220;I reckon they&#8217;re
gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone they are,&#8221; agreed Stuart. &#8220;And
as we don&#8217;t know how or why, it&#8217;s my
opinion that this is no safe place for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rapidly, but thoroughly, they ransacked
the camp for ammunition; but none was to
be found; then they made their way into
the cane-brakes, carefully covering their
tracks as they went, and took up their camp
in a secluded place where an enemy could
not come upon them without their having
due warning of his approach.</p>

<p>From that time on the pair shifted their
camp with each day; they lived much like
the wild things of the wilderness about
them, seldom making a move in any direction
without studying the prospects and
calculating their chances. But in spite of
all this, Boone, with his usual hardihood,
continued to make his inspection of the
country; they extended their explorations
in many directions; and though they lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
in constant peril of their lives, and their
food was reduced to the meat they could
kill, they were not of the sort to cuddle fear
to their breasts and increase their hardships
by complaint. Accustomed to hard living
they took their situation calmly enough;
never once did it occur to them that it
would be best to leave their work incompleted
and return home.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Boone, one night by their
carefully-masked camp-fire, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to
have powder and ball. There are only
a half dozen charges between us; and every
time I let off my rifle I feel that we&#8217;re slipping
that much nearer the finish of the
whole matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some weeks went by in this way; and
one morning as they followed a buffalo
path they heard a steady, long &#8220;clump-clump-clump&#8221;
advancing toward them
from the direction in which they had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buffalo?&#8221; asked Stuart, puzzled.</p>

<p>Boone listened, then shook his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;Horses,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And horses that
are being ridden.&#8221;</p>

<p>With one accord they left the track; they
took up posts behind the trees, their rifles
held ready for anything which might occur.</p>

<p>In a very little while the hoof-beats became
quite close at hand; then from out
of the undergrowth which lined the path
rode a couple of bronzed white men, well
armed, and leading a pair of packhorses.
Amazed, Daniel Boone called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, stranger! Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The riders checked their steeds and turned
their heads in the direction of the hail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; cried one. &#8220;Is that you,
Dan&#8217;l?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;White men and friends,&#8221; answered they
in the customary manner of the wilderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I live,&#8221; cried Boone, starting forward,
&#8220;I think it&#8217;s my brother, Squire.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this one of the men slid from his
horse&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dan&#8217;l!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>The two clasped hands, their eyes full of
pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;We came upon your tracks yesterday,&#8221;
said Squire Boone, who was Daniel&#8217;s junior
by some years. &#8220;But we had more trouble
in following it than if you&#8217;d been a couple
of black foxes anxious to save your pelts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel and John Stuart looked at each
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;We took a lot of trouble to cover those
tracks up from time to time,&#8221; said Stuart,
grimly. &#8220;And we did it to save our
scalps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Squire. &#8220;Injuns?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shawnees!&#8221; answered his brother.</p>

<p>The companion of Squire Boone now
came forward with the packhorses and was
greeted by the two explorers. This man&#8217;s
name is not known to history, but he had
ventured much in attempting that long
journey over mountains, across rushing
rivers and through the vast forests, and so
he will go down as one of the great unknown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
pioneers of the great west&mdash;a goodly
army and a stout-hearted one.</p>

<p>Just how Squire Boone came to appear so
opportunely in the wilderness at the time
he did will perhaps always remain a mystery.
Some have it that he had brooded
long over the absence of his brother, finally
concluded that he must be hard put to it
across the Laurel Ridge, and so went to his
aid. Others hold the theory that it was all
arranged for at the beginning. If Daniel
was not back in the settlements at a given
time, Squire was to set out upon a sort of
relief expedition.</p>

<p>But, however that may be, there he was,
and with two packs of necessary things,
the more important of which were powder
and ball, and flints for their gun-locks.</p>

<p>A new time set in for the hardy adventurers;
in their increased numbers there was
less danger of attack; in their possession of
plenty of ammunition they were better able
to make a defense in case the Shawnees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
should reappear. However, their vigilance
did not relax; they were but four, after all,
and they must be as saving of good black
powder as they could, so they made their
camps in the thick of the cane-brakes
and masked their fires and covered their
tracks.</p>

<p>But in spite of their continued caution,
danger crept upon them stealthily. While
Boone and Stuart were one day in pursuit
of game they came upon an Indian ambuscade.
The savages leaped upon them with
yells, firing as they came. Stuart fell, shot
through and through; but Boone, covering
his flight by the deadly cracking of his
rifle, sped through the woods and escaped.</p>

<p>That night he rejoined Squire and the
other hunter at the place appointed; and
when he told his story a gloom fell upon
the little camp as dark as the fate of poor
Stuart.</p>

<p>But the deadly work of the savages was
not yet done. Only a few days after this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
the man who had accompanied the younger
Boone upon the relief expedition disappeared.
For days the brothers searched for
him. They found the moccasin-made tracks
of the Shawnee hunters all about, but no
trace of the white man was to be found.</p>

<p>And so Daniel Boone and his brother
were left alone in the heart of that savage
country, hundreds of miles from all aid
and with the fate of their companions
weighing heavily upon them. But did this
break down their resolution? Did the
danger which hemmed them in weaken
their stout spirits? Because the wilderness
was hostile, because the red warriors were
relentless, because death hovered over them,
did their hearts misgive them? No!
Rather did it add to their purpose. Their
stubborn spirits were not of the sort to accept
defeat until it was beyond humanity
to refuse it. And they felt that it was far
from that stage as yet.</p>

<p>So they increased their caution, always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
held their weapons ready, lived like the
wild things of the woods, never trusting to
an appearance, never taking a sound for
granted. Through the whole of the winter
they lived this life of peril. And when
spring came, their work not being done and
their provisions and ammunition being low,
it was determined that Squire go back to
the settlements for a fresh supply.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Dan,&#8221; said the unselfish younger
brother, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to leave you here in
the midst of danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel placed his hands upon his shoulders,
and said, gravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are doing your share, when all&#8217;s
said and done. True, there is peril here;
but is there more, lad, than you will face
as you press back across the mountains
alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Squire mounted a horse, waved a
good-bye and set out. Daniel watched him
until the fresh green of the spring growth
hid him from view, and then he turned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
face the wilderness alone. But, undaunted,
he pushed his explorations from day to day
throughout the months which followed;
more and more complete did his knowledge
of the country grow; firmer and firmer became
his conviction that in this region
there would one day grow a great state,
with broad farms and populous cities.</p>

<p>The danger from savages was continuous;
apparently the Indians saw in the presence
of Boone the first step in the invasion of the
white man, and so were eager to check the
movement before it could be fairly started.
At night the lone hunter would steal
through the cane-brake toward his camp;
cautiously he would observe it from a distance,
and noting that it had been visited
during the day, he would steal away as
silently as a shadow.</p>

<p>Boone was a natural woodsman. In him
the craft of the forest and trail reached perfection;
no other man in the annals of the
West possessed the cunning with which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
threw the enemy off the trail and baffled
his pursuit.</p>

<p>Toward the end of July Squire Boone
returned with horses, meal and ammunition.
Then after a time they pressed on
toward the Cumberland River, or what is
now so called, and explored the country in
that direction. More and more beautiful
the region grew to Daniel; more and more
he determined that it would be his future
home.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a paradise on earth,&#8221; he told Squire.
&#8220;There never was such a hunting-ground,
such forests or such a chance for farming.
If any man is to find peace anywhere, it is
in this country which we have discovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>And filled with this thought they completed
their explorations in the following
spring, and then made their way back to
the settlements with the news.</p>

<span class="small">ATTACKED!</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the return of Daniel Boone and his
brother to North Carolina the news of the
beautiful country beyond the ridge began to
spread. People were eager to hear of his
adventures and of his discoveries; and from
all the region around about the Yadkin
they came to listen to him.</p>

<p>A great deal of discontent was abroad in
North Carolina. The government was not
at all what it should have been. Tryon
was a corrupt, overbearing official, detested
by the settlers; and the hardy spirits who
kept the border were not of the sort to submit
to tyranny. So when Boone came back
with the beauties of Kentucky upon his
tongue, the richness of her soil, the size of
her streams and woods and the promise she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
held out to all who were willing to come to
her, he set them all by the ears.</p>

<p>But the settlements were thin and far
between; men were few; conditions were
such that not all could drop their affairs in
the north state and undertake an adventure
into the new land. This being so, by the
time a party of settlers was organized to go
into and take up homesteads in Kentucky,
several years passed.</p>

<p>Among the first to enlist in this expedition
were Oliver Barclay, Eph Taylor and
Sandy Campbell. Eph&#8217;s father meant to
move his whole family into the new region,
and the man for whom Sandy worked was
about to do the same. Well grown, broad
of shoulder and strong as young oaks, the
three made no mean addition to the band.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few years make a great difference,&#8221;
said Boone, as he looked at them. They
were gathered before him by the sides of
the horses upon which they had ridden
over to his place. His head was nodding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
approvingly. &#8220;It&#8217;s such lads as you that
are needed where there&#8217;s forests to be felled
and redskins to be fought.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys listened to his account of his
capture with Stuart by the Shawnees; also
to the long months which he spent alone
in the wilderness, enemies ever upon his
trail, but persisting in his task in the face
of all. And when, at length, they rode
away, their faces were grave, their eyes
shining.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a fine thing to do,&#8221; said Eph,
in great admiration. &#8220;A very fine thing.
I reckon there&#8217;s not another in the settlements
that would have stayed to finish up
with all those dangers crowding around
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always knew that Mr. Boone was like
that,&#8221; said Sandy. &#8220;I&#8217;d watch the way
he&#8217;d ride his horse, or hold his rifle, or
speak to any one who&#8217;d meet him. He
had a way about him that told you he&#8217;d
be a hard man to beat.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;I think to do what you set out to do is
one of the best proofs of quality in a man,&#8221;
spoke Oliver. &#8220;Sometimes it&#8217;s easy, and
sometimes it&#8217;s hard to do; but to do it&#8217;s the
thing, and nothing else will answer if you
mean to be worth anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was late in September in the year 1774
that Boone started, with his family, to take
up his home in the country beyond the
Laurel Ridge. Squire Boone was with
them, and he helped Daniel and his sons
to see to the packhorses, the cattle and the
hogs which were taken to stock the new
farm in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Near Powell&#8217;s Valley, not many miles
distant, the Boones were met by the
Taylors, the family of the farmer for
whom Sandy worked, and a number of
other prospective homesteaders. As the
expedition now stood there were some
forty hardy, courageous men in its column,
armed and ready for the toil of the
march.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>Ahead rode Oliver Barclay, Eph Taylor
and young Campbell with some of the
younger of the men; in a line came the
packhorses and those bearing the women
and children. Boone and the main body
of the settlers rode beside the pack animals,
their rifles across their saddle-bows. In the
rear came the cattle in the care of another
band of youths who had undertaken this
part of the work under the watchful eye of
Boone&#8217;s eldest son.</p>

<p>For a week this formation was kept; at
night they camped at sides of streams with
guards set out to watch for the Indian
prowlers who might have trailed them
during the day and who might now be
waiting for a murderous opportunity from
the underbrush; also the cattle and hogs
were to be kept from the attacks of those
stealthy beasts which prowl the night.</p>

<p>They headed for that break in the
mountain chain afterward known as the
Cumberland Gap; never a sight of a redskin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
was had, never a sign of his trail anywhere.
But there he was, nevertheless, for
just eleven days after the journey began,
while they were passing through a particularly
difficult place, there came a
sudden murderous volley of bullets and
arrows in the rear, a rush of red robbers,
and the scattering of most of the cattle
into the woods. And six of the rear guard,
including Boone&#8217;s son, were left dead in
the trail.</p>

<p>Instantly, upon the firing of the volley,
the column of emigrants came to a halt;
a line of defense was formed and the lightest
of the horsemen began scurrying upon
the trail of the savages who fled through
the passes.</p>

<p>But no blows of consequence were struck,
and the riders returned. That night a
grave council was held. The women were
frightened by the murderous attack; some
of the men began to see visions of constant
fighting ahead with little time for profitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
work; and so they lost heart in the
enterprise. They thought it best that they
return.</p>

<p>But Boone, his brother, and others of the
party were for pushing on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Attacks by the Indians are to be expected,&#8221;
said the pioneer; &#8220;they will always
resist the march of the white man. And
if we are to settle the rich country on the
other side of the hills, it&#8217;s not by weakening
under the first blow they strike. We
must press forward; we must strike back;
we must never for a moment show the varmints
that we fear them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the bold counsel of Daniel was not
listened to. The shock of the attack, the
loss of the cattle, the six youths slain, all
in a moment&#8217;s time, hung heavily over the
spirits of the emigrants, clouding them with
gloom. It was agreed among them that
they would start at sunrise and head back
for the settlements.</p>

<p>On that first spiritless day of the return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
march, Oliver Barclay found himself by the
side of Boone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heading back for Hillsboro?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>Boone shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; for the Virginia settlements on the
Clinch River,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking,&#8221; said Oliver, whose
hopes had received a shattering blow by the
sudden change of front, &#8220;that we need not
give the matter up after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boone looked at him questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are a few who are willing to go
on across the mountains. Suppose, after
we leave those who feel that they must
return at the Clinch settlements, we turn
about and go with the few we can hold
together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the backwoodsman shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you don&#8217;t quite see just what
your uncle, the colonel, wants done,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t start only for the purpose
of getting into the new country. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
idea was to plant a colony. And to do that
we must have people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; persisted Oliver, with boyish
ardor, &#8220;there&#8217;s your family and the
Taylors. And Mr. Miller told Sandy he&#8217;d
keep to the original agreement if any one
else would.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Boone was fixed in his determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must plant a colony of some size if
we plant any at all. A few families would
always be in danger where enough to
supply a couple of score of fighting men,
if needed, would be fairly safe. For Injuns,
youngster, are a careful lot; they
seldom attack when there&#8217;s any danger of
loss. Another thing, the first lot of emigrants
must be numerous enough to attract
others. Men go where men are; it&#8217;s only
a few who have a liking for lonely places.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the saddened column pushed
toward the Clinch River, and Boone&#8217;s first
attempt to settle Kentucky was at an end.</p>

<span class="small">THE THREE BOYS RIDE ON A MISSION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">However</span>, as it chanced, it was just as
well that the first attempt of Daniel Boone
to colonize Kentucky failed. For a little
later, the first muttering of that great
Indian uprising, called the Dunmore War,
began to be heard, and along the whole
border ran the firebrand, the scalping
knife and the tomahawk.</p>

<p>But previous to this outbreak of the
tribes, Boone was engaged in another enterprise
which tested his quality as a woodsman
and explorer. Dunmore, the governor
of Virginia, had some time before sent a
number of surveyors to the country round
about the falls of the Ohio; and now he
desired that these men be guided through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the wilderness back to the settlements.
Boone and a man named Stoner were engaged
for this work, and set out heavily
armed, but carrying little or no baggage.
The surveying party was found and guided
to the settlements according to contract,
and without mishap. The whole journey
was of some eight hundred miles and
through hard country; but the two woodsmen
managed to do it in the remarkable
time of two months.</p>

<p>Louder and louder grew the muttering
of the coming war; closer and closer
pressed the tribes from all points of the
compass. Delawares, Wyandots, Shawnees,
Cayugas and Mingos; the forests gave up
war parties in full paint and feathers each
day; councils were held, dances were
danced; vengeance was to be had, no
matter what the cost, for the wrong that
had been done the great chief Logan by
the whites.</p>

<p>The soldiers were everywhere drilling to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
meet the expected onslaught of the Indians;
the celebrated fighting chiefs, Red
Eagle and Cornstalk, were upon the border,
ripe for the struggle; and Dunmore knew
that if once they gave themselves seriously
to the work of revenge, he&#8217;d be hard pressed
to beat them back.</p>

<p>Soon after his return with the surveying
party, Daniel Boone was made a captain by
the governor and given charge of three
garrisons. And to these came Oliver Barclay
and his friends Eph and Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think Chief Logan will
strike?&#8221; asked Oliver, eagerly, of Boone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like it,&#8221; answered the backwoodsman.
&#8220;Logan has been wronged,
and as he&#8217;s a man of spirit, even if he is
only an Injun, why, he&#8217;s up and ready to
avenge it. In my opinion there&#8217;ll be a flare
along the whole line that&#8217;ll turn many a
night into day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of the settlers in the outlying
places?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been passing the word for them to
come in. Better lose their property than
their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they coming in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good many of them are; others are
waiting to make sure that the redskins will
rise.&#8221; There was a pause and then Boone
proceeded: &#8220;There&#8217;s one thing that worries
me, though, and that&#8217;s the case of those
people at the head of that small branch, to
the southwest. The scouts sent out warned
everybody all through that region but
them; by a kind of misunderstanding they
were not looked after. As it stands, nobody
is sure if they know how things stand
with the Indians or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to have them looked after,
though,&#8221; said Oliver.</p>

<p>Boone looked worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to be done,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I
can&#8217;t go myself, and just now there is nobody
to send.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eph and I will go,&#8221; declared young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Barclay, resolutely; &#8220;maybe Sandy, too&mdash;it&#8217;ll
be good sport and some excitement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And mixed in more than a mite of
danger&mdash;don&#8217;t forget that,&#8221; said Boone.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there was no danger there would be
no excitement,&#8221; laughed Oliver, and away
he swung to search out Eph and the Scotch
boy.</p>

<p>The latter, in preparation for action of
some kind, was whetting the edge of a huge
saber upon a stone which some one had
given him. Eph Taylor sat at his side rubbing
carefully at the lock of his much considered
rifle Jerusha.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in good working order as she
stands,&#8221; said Eph, by way of explanation.
&#8220;And she always shoots true and fair; but
then a little extra looking after won&#8217;t hurt
her now, for there&#8217;s no telling when I&#8217;ll get
the next chance to look after her rightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, there you spoke the truth,&#8221; said
Oliver. &#8220;It may be, indeed, some time,
for we&#8217;re going to take horse in ten minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
and be off to the head of the south
branch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Eph and Sandy at once came to
their feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; asked the latter,
his round, good-natured face all aglow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Logan begun the war?&#8221; asked
Eph.</p>

<p>In a few words Oliver explained the situation;
and in a marvelously short time
Eph&#8217;s rifle was assembled and loaded;
Sandy&#8217;s saber was wiped dry upon a tuft of
grass and sheathed; the horses of all three
were saddled and ready to start.</p>

<p>Boone had followed Oliver, and seeing
them ready and determined, was the last
man in the world to prevent their showing
the quality that was in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look for the Baldwins, the McAfees
and the Curleys,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Find the farm
of one and you&#8217;ll learn from him the location
of the others. And keep your eyes
peeled for Injuns. Don&#8217;t trust to anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
but the sight of your eyes and the touch of
your hands. And if you find occasion to
shoot, shoot swiftly and to kill, for the redskins
are in no humor to be stopped by anything
less than death.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a wave of the hand, the three boys
were off along the winding trail which led
toward the river; and this they followed
all the remainder of the day. They came
to the branch named by Boone toward
nightfall, and went into camp in the midst
of a clump of white oaks.</p>

<p>A turkey cock had fallen a few hours
before under the deadly glance of Jerusha
and while Sandy and Oliver were engaged
in building a fire, Eph stripped the once
proud bird of his feathers and prepared
him for the spit. Sandy had filled his
haversack with hard biscuits which had
been made for the militia, and these, with
the meat of the nicely browned turkey,
made a bountiful supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me to be a foolish thing for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
a great chief like Logan to do&mdash;this war,&#8221;
said Eph, as he picked a turkey bone with
much satisfaction. &#8220;A man like him,
knowing how little chance the Injuns have
against the troops of the colony, ought to
have some horse sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say Dunmore&#8217;s soldiers massacred
his entire family,&#8221; said Oliver. &#8220;Of course,
we can&#8217;t get the facts just yet, but if any of
it is true, why, Logan, being an Indian, can
see nothing else to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many an innocent person will suffer for
the doings of the hungry government and
the red robbers,&#8221; said Sandy with Scottish
foresight. &#8220;And it&#8217;s always so, I suppose,
for they are the least prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>They spent the night among the oaks and
were stirring at an early hour in the morning.
The sun was not an hour old when
they were in the saddle once more and were
riding along the branch in the direction of
the scattered holdings of the detached
settlers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>At noon they halted, allowed their mounts
to graze for an hour and ate a snack themselves.
Then into the saddle once more
and off again along the tangled way. The
sun was sliding down in the west, growing
greater and redder as it went, and the trees
were beginning to cast long shadows in the
bare spaces, when Eph Taylor suddenly
drew up his horse. Holding up a warning
hand, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Like graven figures the boys sat their
horses, their faces turned in the direction
of the setting sun.</p>

<p>Sharp and with rending crispness of a
sound traveling across a great silence, there
came the unmistakable report of a rifle. A
moment later there came another and still
another. A clamor arose above the distant
trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rifle shots!&#8221; cried Eph.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Shawnee war cry!&#8221; said
Oliver.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>As one they inspected the locks of their
pieces and their primings. Again and
again came the rifle shots from the westward;
and again and again from above the
tree tops came the shrill yells of the redskins.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been quite near one of the settlers&#8217;
houses without knowing it,&#8221; spoke Sandy
Campbell. &#8220;And they are being attacked
by Shawnees.&#8221; Looking steadily at his two
friends he added: &#8220;What shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is but one thing we can do,&#8221;
replied Oliver.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s get over there as soon as we
can and do our share in teaching these
varmints a lesson,&#8221; finished Eph.</p>

<p>And they shook the reins of their good
horses and sprang down the bank toward
the brawling branch. There was a ford at
no great distance and this they crossed with
a rush, splashing the water high in the air.
Then up the farther bank they sped and
across a clearing which they perceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
behind a thin fringe of trees. Swift and
soft thudded the hoofs of their dying horses
upon the ground; through the tops of some
ancient oaks they caught the outline of the
chimney of a white man&#8217;s dwelling; and
between the thick growing trunks they saw
the plumes and war paint of the savages
who encircled it.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<span class="small">DEFENDING A LOG CABIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A swift</span> glance showed Oliver Barclay
that there were perhaps twoscore Indians
in the band. Directly in front were about
half this number fighting from behind
stumps, logs and tree trunks.</p>

<p>&#8220;At them at top speed,&#8221; said Oliver,
&#8220;and each pick an important man if you
can see one. After you fire, shout as loud
as you can!&#8221;</p>

<p>Like thunderbolts the three lads swept
down upon the war party of Shawnees.
Shooting from the saddle, with horse going
at top speed, was one of the tricks of marksmanship
cherished and practiced by the
youths at the frontier; and so, as the three
long weapons cracked, three savages sprang
into the air with tossing arms and fell dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
upon the ground. Then yelling like demons
the lads plunged among the others.</p>

<p>Taken utterly by surprise the redskins
were demoralized. Evidently they thought,
judging by the boldness of the attack, that
what they saw was but a part of a large
force of whites; so in the panic of the moment
they turned and fled.</p>

<p>Never checking the speed of their horses
the boys dashed up to the cabin which was
now in full view. Throwing themselves
from their horses they proceeded to wipe
and reload their rifles.</p>

<p>As they were so engaged the door of the
cabin was flung open and an old man with
a flowing white beard appeared upon the
threshold. He had a blood-stained bandage
about his head, and a rifle was gripped
in his hand. Behind him the boys caught
glimpses of a number of anxious faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, lads,&#8221; cried the old
settler, welcomingly. &#8220;How many of you
are there?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;Just the three,&#8221; answered Eph, a grin
on his face.</p>

<p>The man with the white beard looked the
amazement he felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only three, and come a-plunging into
the critters that way?&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur went up from those behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon the Shawnees thought we were
a regiment, at least, the way they ran off,&#8221;
said Oliver, laughing at the recollection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and by this time they&#8217;ve seen their
mistake and will come&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whizz! Thud!&#8221;</p>

<p>The feathered shaft of an arrow quivered
from one of the logs just below Sandy Campbell&#8217;s
shoulder; a hail of others flew all
about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve found it out!&#8221; cried a man
from within the house. As he spoke he
sprang out and threw open the heavy door
of a building adjoining the cabin. &#8220;Quick,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Drive your horses in here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>The boys led the horses through the doorway;
the man followed them in and threw
a heavy oaken bar into place. The sounds
from the cabin showed that the door there
had also been made secure, and then the
siege was once more begun.</p>

<p>There was a doorway leading into the
cabin from the building which was crowded
with horses and cattle. Through this came
the white-bearded man and some others.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re obliged to you, young strangers,
for what you tried to do for us. And we
are sorry that you&#8217;ve run into this danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We rode this way on the word of Captain
Boone that some settlers were perhaps
unwarned of the Indian rising,&#8221; said Oliver.
&#8220;Perhaps you are one of them, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;is
Curley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know anything of the McAfees
and Baldwins who live hereabout?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all here,&#8221; said Mr. Curley.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
&#8220;They grew suspicious of things yesterday,
and rode over, thinking if the worst came
we&#8217;d all be together, and so have a better
chance for defense.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were at least a dozen grown men
gathered in the Curley cabin, and almost as
many boys, some of whom were old enough
to take part in the defense. The wives and
daughters of the settlers were, in the main,
courageous and accustomed to the idea of
danger; some of them, indeed, looked
capable of taking up a rifle and using it
as well as brother or husband. The heavy
timber walls of the house were pierced by
small openings, each of which permitted the
barrel of a rifle to be protruded.</p>

<p>At each of these port-holes was stationed
a man; keen eyes watched the movements
of the Shawnees upon the edge of the clearing,
and now and then a shot rang out or
an arrow whizzed through the air as a red
marksman sought to drive bullet or barb
through an opening.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>While Oliver talked to Mr. Curley and
several of the other settlers and gave them
all the information he possessed as to the
state of the border, Eph Taylor selected an
unguarded port-hole and protruded the
eager muzzle of the faithful Jerusha.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care of yourself, youngster,&#8221; said
a man in buckskins at the next opening.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t trust too much to your port-hole
being narrow; there&#8217;s an Injun there on the
edge of the timber who&#8217;s doing some almighty
good shooting with the bow; several
times he&#8217;s put one of his shafts right
on through.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keenly, Eph scoured the timber line;
from one place or another a rifle cracked, or
a bowstring sang almost constantly. But
he was not long in locating the marksman
of whom the settler had spoken. He lay behind
the uprooted butt of a huge tree
which had resisted both axe and fire; a
thick growth of weeds had sprung up about
it, and it afforded a splendid vantage place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
for a marauder with a quick eye and a
steady hand.</p>

<p>Twice Eph saw an arrow speed from behind
this shelter and bury itself in the timbers
upon the edge of a port-hole. Then a
cry told that a third shot had flown through
and found a mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Through the arm,&#8221; said the man who
had spoken to Eph. &#8220;That varmint out
there has an eye like a hawk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carefully Eph watched the uprooted
stump and studied the method of the savage
sharpshooter behind it. Never once
did he catch sight of any part of the Shawnee;
not for an instant did even so much
as a tip of a plume show above his breastwork.
Satisfying himself as to this, Eph
took to examining other parts about the
tree butt. A stirring in the growth about
its largest end took his eye; the movement
was of the slightest, but the eyes of the boy
were fixed upon it with all the eagerness of
a practiced hunter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>The shadows from the trees had grown
enormously; but the great red sun sent
slanting bars of light through the maze of
trunks here and there; and one of these
caught a metal point just as it was steadily
poised for a shot from behind the butt, and
the glitter attracted the eye of Eph. The
brain of the boy worked like lightning;
from the position of the arrow-head he calculated
the position of the arm that held
the bow. The black eye of Jerusha turned
grimly upon the spot in which Eph&#8217;s judgment
fixed the Shawnee&#8217;s arm; then the
rifle spoke. A cry of pain made answer
and an arrow flew wild, burying its point
in the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon that Injun will need some care
and considerable rest before he&#8217;s much of a
success as a fancy shot in the future,&#8221; remarked
young Taylor, with a grin at his
neighbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a good shot,&#8221; said the man.
&#8220;I sort of felt that Injun was behind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
stump there; but I couldn&#8217;t get any signs
of him nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Darkness drew on; supper was cooked
and eaten in the cabin; part of the defenders
sat down to the meal while a part manned
the port-holes; when the first lot had satisfied
their hunger they changed places with
the watchers. But with the coming of the
night the attack of the Shawnees did not
abate; the cracking of their rifles went on,
the whizzing of the arrows continued.
Finally there came a flare through the
darkness; it was as though a ball of fire
had described an arch, and then fallen
with a thud on the roof.</p>

<p>The faces of the settlers blanched.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fire arrow!&#8221; said one.</p>

<p>&#8220;The varmints are trying to burn the
house over our heads,&#8221; cried another.</p>

<p>But old Mr. Curley took the matter
coolly enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be alarmed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As it
happens, friends, the roof is of new green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
wood, cut and put on only this summer; so
the arrows won&#8217;t set fire to it in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ball after ball of fire, each attached to a
cunningly aimed arrow, fell upon the roof.
But the green wood would not take the fire
readily, as the old settler had prophesied.
Seeing this the savages ceased throwing the
fire arrows, and there fell a silence over all
outdoors as complete as the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something is going forward,&#8221; spoke
Sandy, his eye at a port-hole endeavoring
to pierce the black pall which enveloped
everything. &#8220;The villains are not so quiet
as that for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was, indeed, something ominous in
the silence; the night seemed crowded with
the grotesque forms of fear; a feeling that
there was something&mdash;a dreadful something&mdash;pressing
toward them, settled upon
the defenders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready all!&#8221; said the man in the buckskins.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have them down on us in a
moment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;And remember, lads,&#8221; warned old Mr.
Curley, &#8220;our powder is not too plentiful.
So don&#8217;t waste a shot. Be sure of your
Injun before you pull trigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prediction of the man in buckskin
was, a moment later, fulfilled. Silent as
ghosts the Shawnees had formed a complete
circle about the cabin and crept across the
clearing toward it. Now they were close
enough for a rush; the war-whoop, that
thing of fear on the border, rang out; the
red braves, dusky and but faintly seen,
were under the log walls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sure of your shots!&#8221; cried old Mr.
Curley; &#8220;pick your redskin, lads, and don&#8217;t
waste the good black powder!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_135.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE RIFLES SPOKE THROUGH THE PORT-HOLES</p>

<p>With cold precision the rifles spoke
through the port-holes, and in each case
a yell told of a warrior hit. But the
Shawnees were not idle. Unseen, they had
borne with them great armfuls of dry
brush; under the fire of the rifles they
heaped them against the door of the cabin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Like cats others scaled the walls and gained
the roof.</p>

<p>The first flare of the fire when the brush
was ignited acted badly for the Shawnees,
however. Apparently they had failed to
foresee that they would be thrown into
full relief by the glare; at any rate the
deadly rifles of the whites swept a rain
of lead among them, and a dozen fell to
the earth. Enraged, the remainder charged
the house, brandishing tomahawks and
scalping knives; bowstrings sang and
rifles cracked; the flames about the door
mounted higher and higher.</p>

<p>Calmly the backwoodsmen went about
the work of defense; steadily they loaded
and fired; watchfully they peered through
the port-holes.</p>

<p>But up to this time all had failed to hear
those savages who had mounted to the roof.
Safe out of the fire of the deadly rifles, a
half score braves were here collected, cunningly
planning their next move.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>At one end of the log house there was a
wide-mouthed chimney, built of green wood
and thickly lined with mud. The fire over
which the settlers&#8217; supper had been cooked
had died down and peering down the
smooth interior of this shaft, the Shawnees
grinned with dreadful satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;That fire outside there is taking hold,&#8221;
said old Mr. Curley below in the big room
of the cabin. &#8220;The timber in the door is
heavy, but as dry as tinder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anxiously the men looked at each other;
the faces of the women were fearful. And
in this tense moment there came a scrambling
sound, a cloud of dust arose from the
fireplace together with a shower of dull
sparks. A woman screamed as the tufted
head of an Indian appeared in the great
fireplace to be followed an instant later by
another and still another.</p>

<span class="small">A NIGHT EXPERIENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Following</span> the scream of the woman,
Eph Taylor turned around. He was the
first of the riflemen to catch sight of the
intruders. Like a flash the eye of Jerusha
ceased to stare upon the wild scenes going
on outside; it swept inward and the crack
of the good rifle spoke the death of a
Shawnee. Oliver&#8217;s piece accounted for
another; two more fell in the act of braining
a defender with their hatchets.</p>

<p>Taking warning from the deaths of the
more adventurous the Shawnees upon the
roof of the cabin made no more attempts
by way of the chimney. Old Mr. Curley
shrewdly judged that the swift fate which
had overtaken their comrades would have
this effect, but nevertheless he made sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
there would be no more surprises from that
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick,&#8221; said he, to one of his sons, a
stalwart youth who had been firing from
one of the port-holes with a pair of horseman&#8217;s
pistols, &#8220;see to the fireplace. Don&#8217;t
take your eyes off it, and if you catch
sight of a red hide, fill it full of holes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the most important thing of all
was to scatter the fire from the door before
it did serious harm. The brush was blazing
furiously and that the door was also burning
they felt sure, judging from the jets of
smoke and flame that shot between the
heavy planks. The man in buckskin, who
was a trapper of the region and not connected
with the little settlement on the
fork, now ventured a plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let one man stand ready to throw open
the door, let another have a pail of water
to throw on the outside of it where it is
burning, and two more stand ready to kick
away the brush. But before the door is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
open we&#8217;ll drive the Injuns in front to cover;
while they are still running will be the
time to act.&#8221;</p>

<p>As this plan was as good as any, they at
once proceeded to put it into operation.
The rifles increased their deadly cracking
and the Shawnees, who had continued their
charges in order to keep the fire supplied
with fresh brush, were unable to stand up
under it. Helter skelter they fled for cover;
the door was thrown open, the brush kicked
away and a drench of water sent streaming
over the burning planks. Then the door
was slammed shut before the infuriated redskins
had much idea of what was taking
place, the bar dropped into its sockets, and
the whites were permitted to breathe easier,
now that all immediate danger from fire
was past.</p>

<p>There followed some scattered volleys
from the savages; but after a time a silence
fell; and some distance away camp-fires
began to sparkle in the forest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;ve withdrawn for a while at least,&#8221;
spoke Mr. Curley. &#8220;They will eat their
meat at the fires and the cunning ones
among them will arrange another plan of
attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliver and his friends during this lull
gathered at one end of the cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said young Barclay,
&#8220;that the Indians mean to take this house
one way or another. Even if they can&#8217;t
capture it by attack they can starve us
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eph Taylor nodded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;That&#8217;s what it will
end with if help doesn&#8217;t come, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a fresh horse and a clear way
through the Shawnees, I could make Captain
Boone&#8217;s garrison by noon to-morrow,&#8221; said
Oliver. &#8220;So why wait on the chance that
help will come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Noll!&#8221; cried Sandy; &#8220;you don&#8217;t mean
to say that you&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a case like this,&#8221; said Oliver, firmly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
&#8220;waiting is a mistake. Ill luck is as likely
to befall as good. If they&#8217;ll let me, I&#8217;m
going to venture it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment he had left them and was
eagerly engaged with Mr. Curley, the Baldwins
and the McAfees. The man in buckskins
also entered into the talk. Earnestly
Oliver laid his thought before them; soberly
they considered it; gravely they discussed
its merits.</p>

<p>&#8220;My horse Hawk is like a cat at night,&#8221;
said Oliver. &#8220;He is absolutely sure-footed
and seems able to see in the dark. If I can
win through the Shawnees he&#8217;ll carry me
to Boone&#8217;s camp like the wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The white-bearded Mr. Curley laid his
hand kindly upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a brave lad,&#8221; said he; &#8220;and it&#8217;s
with spirits like yours that success lies. So
if you are eager to undertake this thing, I
will not be one to lift my voice against it;
for indeed its carrying out may mean the
lives of us all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>There was a murmur at this; all seemed
to be of the same idea.</p>

<p>Without delay, Oliver went into the building
where the horses were tied. Hawk
lifted his head and rubbed his nose upon
his young master&#8217;s shoulder. The young
horse had gained in power since the day of
his race with the wicked mount of Long
Panther; and his increased years had lost
him his coltish tricks. As he stood now he
was a swift, intelligent horse of the sort
which can be depended upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, old fellow,&#8221; spoke the boy as he
finished with the saddle and stood patting
Hawk&#8217;s neck. &#8220;This is going to be a very
lively night for both of us. So do your
best for me; more depends on your heels
to-night than ever before in your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sharply Eph Taylor scoured the clearing
before the cabin; other eyes, equally eager
and intent, did the like for the sides and
the rear. But keen as was their vision they
could penetrate but a short distance into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
the blackness. What was beyond the range
of their sight they could only imagine.</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as I can see,&#8221; said Eph, &#8220;there&#8217;s
no one to stop you. But,&#8221; and he stroked
his long chin, &#8220;that&#8217;s not very far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I give the word, open the door
very softly,&#8221; said Oliver. He then shook
hands with those who pressed about him,
wishing him a safe journey through the
night; then he spoke quietly to Eph and
Sandy. A moment later the door had
opened and closed behind him.</p>

<p>Cautiously he turned his head from side
to side, listening; Hawk stood as still as
a beast of bronze, seeming to understand
something of the danger of which he was a
partaker. No sound reached the lad; from
off among the trees he saw the flitting
forms of the Indians about the camp-fires;
but none of them seemed nearer. During
the time spent at the port-holes of the
Curley cabin, young Barclay had observed
the lie of the land, thinking there might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
come a time when a dash for liberty would
be their only chance. This served him
well now in the darkness; mounting, he
turned his horse&#8217;s head in the direction
furthest removed from the Indian camp-fires,
and so began his journey.</p>

<p>There was, as he had observed, an opening
in the forest growth in this direction,
and he trusted to the &#8220;night sight&#8221; and
instinct of Hawk to find it.</p>

<p>In this his confidence was in every way
warranted; in a direct line, apparently, the
good horse made for the opening. But
scarcely had he gained the blacker shadows
cast by the trees on either side, than the
horse stopped with a snort. At the same
instant a number of forms leaped from the
sides of the path, and Oliver was dragged
to the ground.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<span class="small">THE BATTLE OF POINT PLEASANT</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> he had received a blow upon
the head, or had been stunned by the force
of the fall from his horse, Oliver Barclay
did not know. But, in any event, when he
recovered consciousness, he found himself
bound hand and foot and securely fastened
to a tree in the heart of the Shawnee camp.</p>

<p>Near him sat a young savage whose left
hand was swathed in bandages; and in
the flickering firelight which fell upon
this brave&#8217;s face, Oliver recognized Long
Panther.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the lad with as much unconcern
as he could assume, &#8220;you have me,
Long Panther.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coppery face of the Shawnee turned
toward the white boy; and the light of the
fire was not more deep than the light in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
eyes. But beyond this he showed nothing
but the stoical front of his race.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we have you. And I
do not think another will mount and ride
for help to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not, if he&#8217;s not to have better
fortune than I&#8217;ve had,&#8221; said Oliver.</p>

<p>&#8220;In two suns we could take the cabin of
the white man,&#8221; said Long Panther, his
burning eyes turning in the direction of
the Curley cabin. &#8220;But the time is short.
At dawn we must take the trail. The
Mingo chief, Logan, calls, and we go to him
that we may strike a harder blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliver felt a thrill of gladness at the news
that the siege upon the log house was to be
lifted, and that the Shawnees were about to
abandon their purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had only known that,&#8221; was his
thought, &#8220;I might have stayed comfortably
inside and learned in the morning that all
danger was past.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, as the venture he had made had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
seemed the best thing to do under the
circumstances, he did not waste any regrets
upon it; instead, he gave up his thoughts
entirely to the situation in which he found
himself, and began studying out a plan of
escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many things,&#8221; said Long Panther,
somberly, &#8220;I have suffered at the hands of
the white man. And I have desired vengeance.
This,&#8221; and he held up his bandaged
left hand, &#8220;is the last.&#8221;</p>

<p>That Long Panther had been the marksman
behind the tree butt now, for the first
time, occurred to Oliver; the bullet from
Eph&#8217;s rifle had found a shining mark, indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the hand with which I hold the
bow,&#8221; mourned the young savage. &#8220;And
in the battles that are to come, I cannot
do the work that has been given me. But
the white face will pay,&#8221; said he, as he
arose to his feet and stood looking down
at Oliver. &#8220;The white face will pay.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>He turned and stalked away; and as the
eyes of the white boy followed him there
seemed to be an ominous something in the
very way in which he bore himself&mdash;a
threat of reprisal that was to come.</p>

<p>But whatever gloomy fears found a place
in young Barclay&#8217;s mind, they were not
realized that night at least. He slept
where he lay, under guard of three unwinking
redskins. And when morning
came he was given some food, his hands
were pinioned behind him, and with a
rope tied about his body, the other end of
which was fast to the saddle of a warrior,
he was forced to march in the midst of the
band which began filing through the forest
toward the great meeting place of the hostile
tribes.</p>

<p>On the way they were joined by other
war parties of their own nation; and by
nightfall of the following day, young Barclay
found himself in the heart of a vast
Indian encampment. Far into the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
he saw the council fires burning and saw
the chiefs and head men of the nations
gathered in conference. He heard the
celebrated Logan. He heard Cornstalk
and his great son Elenipsico as they stood
out before the leaders of the tribes and
poured forth their torrents of eloquence.
That he understood little or nothing of the
Indian language made scarcely any difference
in the effect the orations had upon the
boy. The manner of the great chiefs, their
expressions as they recounted their grievances,
the fierce passion of their appeal to
the silent circle with its iron faces, sent a
chill to his heart. He saw that the coming
struggle was to be no mean one, that the
frontier was, indeed, to be a blaze from end
to end.</p>

<p>But what was to be done in his own case
of course naturally interested him more
than anything else. In a time like this,
when open war was declared and the tribes
gathered to defy the forces of the colonies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
prisoners were seldom taken, and when
they were, it was for the purpose of putting
them to the torture.</p>

<p>Oliver had heard the grisly tales the old
frontiersmen had to tell of the stake, of the
running of the gauntlet, and the various
other barbarities that the savage mind conceived,
and visions of these rose before his
eyes. But, for all, he was shrewd enough
and clear-sighted enough to perceive that
these things were gone through with at the
Indians&#8217; leisure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now,&#8221; he told himself, &#8220;they have
much more important matters before them;
I shall get their attention later; and even
at that, much sooner, perhaps, than I want
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Virginia Legislature had called into
being an army of something more than a
thousand fighting men, and these were now
encamped at a place called Point Pleasant,
not more than a few hours&#8217; ride from the
encampment of Logan and his fellow chiefs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Oliver drew from his captor&#8217;s manner that
the day of battle was near; but that it was
to be on the one that was next to break he
had no idea until the dawn brought those
preparations which were unmistakable.
Like a great fan the Mingos, the Wyandots,
the Cayugas, the Delawares and the
Shawnees spread themselves through the
forest; like panthers stalking their prey
they advanced.</p>

<p>And this knowledge put a great hope in
his heart, for on the morning his guards
had not bound his arms with their customary
care; in their hurry to be gone they
had slighted this duty; and now Oliver
knew that it required only a slight struggle
to give him the use of his hands. However,
he made no sign of this, plodding on
in the midst of the Shawnees, apparently
dejected and heavy of mind, but in reality
keenly observant and watching like a hawk
for any chance that would give him liberty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Now as it happened, some of the whites
desired fresh meat that morning and a
hunting party of two was in pursuit of
deer. These hunters, swift of foot and
eager, were following the deer tracks and,
for the time, never dreaming of the enemy;
then they plunged upon the main body of
the Indians and for an instant were so
struck with surprise that they stood motionless
and staring. A scattering of rifle
shots followed; one of the men dropped to
the earth, the other bounded away into the
thicket and made back toward the encampment
of the Virginia army. A few hours
later the still advancing Indians encountered
several large bodies of whites drawn
up in military array. Under cover of a
flight of arrows the savages drew back; and
the voices of Cornstalk and Logan were
lifted, calling on them to be as cunning as
foxes and unyielding as rocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;This day,&#8221; said Logan, &#8220;shall see the
redressing of much wrong, my children.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
We shall strike the hand which is lifted
over us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sons of the forest!&#8221; cried the really
noble savage, Cornstalk, &#8220;stand fast! The
white faces are before you. The sun has
lifted upon the day which is to give you
victory!&#8221;</p>

<p>Having reached a ground which would
give them an advantage, the Indians made
a stand and began to rain arrows and lead
upon the soldiers of the colony. In almost
the first fire the colonels of the two regiments
fell dead. A confusion seized the
troops, and as it spread from rank to rank
they began a retreat full of disorder.</p>

<p>This panic of the whites was seen by
Oliver as he stood under guard among the
trees, and the boy&#8217;s heart sank at the sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;They run!&#8221; said a voice beside him,
and turning he recognized Long Panther.
&#8220;They run like wolves before a forest fire.
And you, my white brother, thought they
would strike hard and save you!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>Oliver made no reply; and the young
Shawnee spoke to the guard in the Indian
tongue. They seemed pleased at his words
and called out to some others who stood by,
not taking part in the attack. Like a flash
the message ran along the line of the Indians;
and Oliver, though he did not dream
of what was coming, saw their grim looks
turned upon him and caught a savage satisfaction
in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once,&#8221; said Long Panther, &#8220;you felt
proud of your fleetness; in your pride you
thought you could outrun the Shawnees.&#8221;
His glowing eyes fixed themselves upon
Oliver, glowing with a deeper fire than
ever. &#8220;And I,&#8221; went on Long Panther,
&#8220;told you there might come a day when
the Shawnee&#8217;d run you a race. That day
has now come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked the white
boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are your friends,&#8221; and Long Panther
pointed toward the retreating regiments.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
&#8220;We give you permission to go to
them if&mdash;if you can outrun the arrows
which will follow you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliver Barclay&#8217;s face blanched; but a
resolution showed in his tightening jaw.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I refuse&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse may befall you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Oliver hesitated; he saw
the line of Indians, their copper-colored
faces full of anticipation, the deadly bows
in their hands. But he said, firmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;What chance have I? Your brothers
will pierce me before I&#8217;ve taken a dozen
steps.&#8221; His eyes searched the ground
ahead, and then he added: &#8220;Give me a
start. Let me reach the boulder yonder
before you give the word, and I will run.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree,&#8221; said Long Panther, with savage
satisfaction.</p>

<p>He once more spoke to the Shawnees
about him and again the word was passed
along the line. And the satisfaction of Long
Panther was reflected in the faces of all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;When my white brother is ready,&#8221; said
the maimed bowman looking at Oliver, &#8220;I
will speak the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliver braced himself for the ordeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Long Panther cried out a warning to the
warriors; then to Oliver he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Run!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_158.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">HE INCREASED HIS SPEED</p>

<p>With his hands held behind him by the
loosened thongs, Oliver started to run. To
the right the Cayugas, the Mingos and the
Wyandots were still pressing after the
whites; but directly ahead all was clear.
With his eyes on the boulder the boy ran
slowly. This he thought the better way,
as to show a burst of speed might excite
the savages, and they might loose their
arrows before the time agreed. As it was,
their merciless natures quickly manifested
themselves; when within a little distance
of the rock an arrow whizzed by the boy&#8217;s
head. Feeling sure that this would be instantly
followed by more, he increased his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
speed; with a headlong plunge he was behind
the boulder, and a whirring as of a
hundred pairs of wings was all around him,
the arrows knocking up clouds of dust as
they struck the ground.</p>

<p>A wild yell went up from the Shawnees
as the boy disappeared behind the rock; at
once they saw that he had shrewdly calculated
upon this shelter when he asked
that they not fire until he reached it. And
with hatchet, knife and spear, they rushed
at him.</p>

<p>Oliver slipped his hands free of the
thongs, his quick glance going about to
see what was the next best thing to do.
And then as the savages sped toward him
he heard a shout&mdash;deep and charged with
victory. A third regiment of whites had
advanced to the support of the panic-stricken
ones; their rifle fire was deadly
and they came at full speed. The Mingos,
the Wyandots and Cayugas faltered in the
face of this unexpected blow; and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
fell back upon the line of Delawares and
Shawnees.</p>

<p>At sight of the cloud of warriors in full
retreat, the Shawnees rushing upon Oliver
paused. Here was graver and more earnest
work than the harrying of a single boy and
so they turned and hastened to the support
of their friends.</p>

<p>Realizing what had happened, the white
boy was off like a shot toward the lines of
the advancing frontiersmen; how he gained
this over a field swept by bullets and arrows
he never understood, but gain it he did and
a few minutes later with the rifle, powder-horn
and bullet-pouch of a fallen soldier,
he was loading and firing in the ranks
with as much coolness and dispatch as the
best of them.</p>

<p>The Indians must have had an advance
party on the battle-ground some time before
the main body, for it was now learned
that their retreat was to a line of fortification
made of logs, earth and brush. Behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
this they stood firm. The Indians
showed that they were possessed of many
rifles and a good store of powder; for
hours there was a blaze of fire from across
the breastwork; and the barbed arrows
drove like messengers of death among the
whites. Fully fifteen hundred fighting
men were behind the fortification and continually
the voices of Red Eagle, of Cornstalk
or Logan could be heard urging them
to fight on.</p>

<p>Charge after charge was made upon this
strong place by the Virginia army; General
Lewis saw his men falling all about
him and realized after a little time that
some other method must be pursued if he
was to save his force from annihilation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try and get a body of troops in their
rear,&#8221; was a suggestion which he instantly
grasped. As it happened, the bank of the
Kanawha River favored such a movement;
three picked companies under three dare-devil
leaders were sent to make the attempt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>There was a small stream called Crooked
Creek which flowed into the Kanawha.
The three companies managed to cross
this; its banks were covered with a rank
growth of tall weeds; and through this
crept the whites upon the unsuspecting
savages.</p>

<p>At a word a deadly volley swept into the
dense body of Indians; taken utterly by
surprise, they were thrown into complete
confusion. No foe had been expected from
that quarter, and, from the fury of the onset,
they thought it must be a heavy body
of reinforcements. Completely disheartened
they gave way; as the sun went down they
were retreating across the Ohio River; and
at the fall of night were pressing on through
the forest toward their distant villages.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<span class="small">THE FORT AT BOONESBOROUGH</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the battle of Point Pleasant, which
was the most severe engagement with
Indians in the history of Virginia, the
tribes sent messengers to make peace with
the governor. In this treaty the Shawnees
gave up all claim to the country beyond the
ridge.</p>

<p>As the time for the settlement of this
great region was completely ripe, Colonel
Henderson rode to Boone&#8217;s place on the
Clinch River.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chickasaws we can&#8217;t reach,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;But we can the Cherokees. I want
you to visit the chief of that nation and
purchase, for my company, all their rights
in the new country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Promptly Boone started off on this
mission. Penetrating to the Cherokee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
country he opened negotiations with the
chiefs and head men of that tribe. Success
met him on every hand; the result was
that Colonel Henderson later met the Indians
in solemn council at Fort Wataga;
the price was paid and the deed was signed;
and thereafter Kentucky was, of right, free
of all Indian claims.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Boone to the colonel,
&#8220;the next thing to do is to take possession.
And I calculate that the least delay in that,
the better for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this advice Colonel Henderson gave
willing ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;As all affairs with the Indian nations
are settled,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I think what you
say is the right thing to do. But to tempt
emigrants we must have a way for them to
get into the new country without so much
hardship. Enlist a company of men and
cut a way through the wilderness to the
place where you think a colony can be
planted.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>This was a tremendous task, but Daniel
Boone was the man to undertake it. The
hardy spirits of the border had confidence
in his ability, and when he went among
them for volunteers upon this new enterprise,
they responded readily enough.
Oliver Barclay was to go with the party
in the interest of his uncle, and Eph and
Sandy, full of the desire for the wilderness,
were among the first to offer themselves.</p>

<p>Mounted upon Hawk, for the good horse
had escaped the Indians upon the night of
his master&#8217;s capture and wandered back to
the Curleys&#8217; cabin, Oliver rode along with
Boone over the same trail they had traveled
upon the previous attempt to get beyond
the mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;This time,&#8221; said Oliver, &#8220;we&#8217;ll reach
the new country. For I suppose the Indians
are fairly well satisfied by the terms
they made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boone shook his head; there was a tightening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
about his mouth, and his eyes held a
look of unbelief.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Injuns are queer varmints,&#8221; spoke
he. &#8220;And they don&#8217;t regard their word
very highly. Now Cornstalk, Logan and
their kind mean what they say; but the
rank and file never give it a second thought
if a good chance comes to them to use their
hatchets and scalping knives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Eph Taylor, &#8220;there may be
trouble even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this country and for years to come
you can surely expect trouble,&#8221; said Boone.
&#8220;White and red will never live at peace for
very long at a time. There will always be
something to stir up a war.&#8221;</p>

<p>The band gathered by Boone were good
riders, accustomed all their lives to living
in the open; sturdy axemen, men full of
the vim and that perseverance which was
so marked in their leader.</p>

<p>The path by which they traveled was
well indicated; those who came after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
would have no difficulty in following it.
The month of March was drawing toward
its close when one day they halted at a
small stream to drink; they had dismounted
and for the moment their attention
was relaxed. Suddenly, without a
moment&#8217;s warning, a volley rang out from
a dense thicket, two of the party fell to
the earth&mdash;dead&mdash;and two others were
wounded.</p>

<p>This attack was much like that on the
previous expedition; never for a moment
did the whites suspect that the redskins
were near. But there the similarity ended.
This time the pioneers had no women and
children to think of; also they were, in the
main, well-trained, crafty Indian fighters,
and not a band of careless boys engaged in
driving cattle.</p>

<p>The reports of the Indian rifles had
hardly died away when each of the adventurers
had gained a cover, tree, stump or
rock; short and sharp spoke their unerring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
pieces and the ensuing yells told of braves
who had paid for the attack with their
lives.</p>

<p>Seeing that the white men were in no
wise daunted by the onslaught and were
determined to make a grim resistance, the
Indians, who had little stomach for this
sort of battle, withdrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are gone,&#8221; spoke young Barclay,
as he mounted a hillock and saw
the band skirting the forest, almost a mile
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the time,&#8221; answered Boone. &#8220;They
don&#8217;t care for a stand-up fight; but they&#8217;ll
always be ready for the rifle-shot from
ambush. Always expect them, lads; that&#8217;s
the only way to get through in safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>Warily the pioneers proceeded along the
track which afterward became known as
&#8220;Boone&#8217;s Way&#8221;; but in spite of all this
caution the guile of the red man over-matched
them; three days after the first
ambush, they fell into another; two more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
of the party fell dead, and three were
wounded.</p>

<p>But grimly they fought the savages
back; resolutely they pressed forward on
their way toward the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand by me, lads,&#8221; said Boone, &#8220;and
all the Injuns in the region won&#8217;t drive us
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Early in April they reached the Kentucky
River; on the south side of this was
a fairly clear space, near a salt lick much
used by the forest creatures. With an eye
to all that was needed for a place of defense,
Boone selected this place and at once the
work of erecting a fort began.</p>

<p>Scattered through the forest were a number
of riflemen whose business it was to
warn the workers of the approach of an
enemy; the axemen made the hills and
woods ring with their strokes; the trees
came crashing down to be lopped of their
limbs, cut into lengths and fitted into place.
Log upon log the famous fort of Boonesborough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
so famous in the annals of
Kentucky and the West, arose in sturdy
strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make her bullet-proof and high
enough to keep the redskins outside,&#8221; said
Boone, as he labored with his men in their
work of construction.</p>

<p>The fort was two hundred and sixty feet
in length and one hundred and fifty in
breadth and was made up of a series of
cabins, each of heavy logs and connected
by a high fence of logs, pointed at the top
as a sort of stockade. There was a cabin at
each corner of the fort; all the cabin doors
and windows opened inside the stockade.
The only egress was by way of a heavy gate
opening toward the river and another
which opened upon the opposite side.</p>

<p>During the months of April and May
and partly into June of the year 1774, the
adventurers hewed and wrought upon their
defense; in this time one man was killed by
the hostiles; after that, however, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
no sight or sound of the enemy. In the
middle of June all was finished.</p>

<p>Colonel Henderson and some members
of the company which had purchased the
rights of the Cherokees arrived shortly
after this; and with them came twoscore
settlers, a train of packhorses and many
things which made life easier for the pioneers.</p>

<p>It was Colonel Henderson who gave the
stronghold the name of Boonesborough, in
honor of the brave woodsman who had
dared so much for the founding of the new
commonwealth; and much elated over the
recognition given his service, Boone started
back toward the Clinch River with a few
companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have plenty of men,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but
it will never be a recognized settlement
without families. So I&#8217;m going to set an
example to others by bringing out mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in October that Daniel Boone
turned his back finally upon the eastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
settlements; and with some other hardy
adventurers and their families, he set out
once more through the Cumberland Gap
and into the wilderness which they were to
make bloom as a garden.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<span class="small">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a time the little settlement on the
Kentucky grew and prospered without
much notice from the Indians; but it was not
long before the first rumblings of the Revolution
were heard in that far-off place; it
was learned, with alarm, that the colonies
were rising in arms against England.</p>

<p>When the clash came and the colonists
began to strike determinedly for their
rights, the English agents in the northwest
began operations which once more lighted
the fires of border warfare. They bribed
the savages with gifts, they supplied them
with guns and ammunition and bid them
wipe out the little settlements which
courage and toil had built up in the
wilderness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Along the borders of the north and the
west the terrible war-whoop once more
rang out, and the tomahawk and scalping
knife resumed their deadly work. But
Boonesborough remained calm and unruffled;
its settlers hunted and fished, cleared
the land and planted scanty crops of corn.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1776 a man was killed
by a swift-moving war party; not until the
summer, about the very time when the
Congress at Philadelphia was giving to the
world its first great message of liberty, did
the great war cast its first ominous shadow
upon Boonesborough.</p>

<p>The July sun shone upon the bright
waters of the Kentucky; the breeze stirred
among the trees. A bark canoe, propelled
by the handsome Betsey Collaway, daughter
of a settler, her younger sister Frances, and
a young daughter of Daniel Boone, was
darting here and there like a bird. The
girls had decked the little craft with wild
flowers, gathered along the banks, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
ring of their laughter floated across the
river in happy chorus.</p>

<p>Any one listening might have noticed
that the joyous sound suddenly died away.
For the canoe, as it drifted under a high
bank, shoved its nose into the mud; and as
the girls were about to push it off, they saw
the bushes part almost beside them and a
number of Indians, their fingers upon their
lips calling for silence, step to the water&#8217;s
edge.</p>

<p>Sheer fright kept the girls mute for an
instant; and in the next it was too late to
cry out, for the savages had entered the
canoe, and were threatening them with
their hatchets.</p>

<p>When they saw them huddled, overcome
with terror, at one end of the canoe, they
seized the paddles and drove the craft out
into the river; night was falling and the
passage was not noticed from the fort; and
so the Indians gained the other shore.
The girls were forced out of the boat and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
with the weapons of their merciless captors
ever threatening them they were led away
through the forest.</p>

<p>The girls were first missed by the women
of their families; a search showed that they
were not within the stockade. Instantly
the news spread; men dropped their tasks
and became alert and active.</p>

<p>Questions flew about; and Sandy Campbell,
coming from a runlet where he had
been fishing, caught the sense of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why, I saw them
up the river a little way, in a canoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>A half dozen bark crafts were in a very
few moments being driven up and across
the stream. The twilight was long and the
July day still persisted, but nothing of the
missing ones was to be seen. Long and
loud the men in the canoes shouted; but
no sound came in answer. Eph Taylor,
from the craft in which were also Sandy
and Oliver, spied something under a bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;A canoe!&#8221; he cried.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>In a few moments the other searchers
were at their sides; all made for the bank.
It was the canoe used by the girls!</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care!&#8221; warned Boone. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
anybody get ashore!&#8221;</p>

<p>From his own canoe the backwoodsman
scanned the bank. The daylight was still
strong enough for him to see the imprint
of the moccasined feet in the soft ooze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Injuns!&#8221; said Boone.</p>

<p>A murmur went up from the settlers;
the import of the signs was plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have made off into the woods!&#8221;
cried one of the men, excitedly. &#8220;We
must not waste a minute; we must take
the trail at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>Boone pointed grimly at the sun, which
was now well down upon the horizon line.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a quarter of an hour it will be
dark,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And no trailer that ever
stepped can follow an Injun track by
torch-light. We&#8217;ll have to wait for morning.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>The night was spent in seeing to rifles
and pistols and getting some snatches of
sleep. At the first faint sign of dawn the
trailing party, in which was Boone, Oliver
and his two friends, took up the signs at
the river brink and followed them off into
the woods.</p>

<p>As cunning as foxes the Indians, knowing
that they would be swiftly hunted by
the whites, took pains to hide their trail
from the very start. And the methods
used threw off the trackers for a short time.
Into a dense cane-brake led the tracks, and
then they seemed to disappear. Keenly,
eagerly the hunters sought here and there,
but the wile of the savage baffled them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lads,&#8221; said Boone, finally, wiping his
brow, and leaning upon his long rifle,
&#8220;there&#8217;s no use in wasting time. As soon
as the varmints got into the cane they separated
and slipped through it like ghosts.
And we might hunt for hours and never
pick up the trail.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked one of the men. &#8220;What
shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Boone led the way to the point at which
the footprints ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where they separate,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;but the separation is not for good; they
keep the same general direction. And that
shows that they intend to meet somewhere
further on when they think we&#8217;ve been
thrown off the track completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woodsmen looked at the tracks once
more and nodded their appreciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we work on that,&#8221; proceeded
Boone. &#8220;This bit of cane is a big one;
let&#8217;s skirt it and run the chance of coming
on the trail at the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>At once this was decided on by the
party; with the long, swinging stride of
the hunter they journeyed around the
cane; this forced them to cover some thirty
miles, but at the end they found that
Boone&#8217;s reasoning had been correct; the
Indians had come together somewhere in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
the tangle and there lay their trail, plainly
read by all.</p>

<p>Trained woodsmen all, with the exception
of the three boys, and even these possessed
no mean skill, the settlers looked to Boone
for the word of command.</p>

<p>&#8220;From now on, lads,&#8221; said the backwoodsman,
&#8220;we shall have less trouble.
Look, the trail leads directly to a buffalo
path; they think they&#8217;ve thrown us off,
and they&#8217;ve grown careless.&#8221;</p>

<p>Softly, swiftly the trailers struck into the
path; as Boone had said, the savages had
grown careless; their trail was broad and
deep and could have been followed by the
least skilful.</p>

<p>The day was well advanced, and the
hardy band had covered a full forty miles
through the tangled wilderness. But they
were trained to long journeys and did not
tire.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re gaining,&#8221; said Boone, after an
hour or so of steady following on the heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
track. &#8220;They passed here no more than a
half hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>The caution of the party increased; they
knew the savage nature of the Indians.
Let the latter get a whisper of pursuit and
the lives of their captives would be snuffed
out. The long shadows began to fall in the
forest; the patches of sky to be seen
through the tree tops grew gray. Suddenly
Boone held up his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they are!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Through the dense growth he pointed to
a party of Indians; a few of them were
dressing freshly killed game; others were
engaged in kindling a fire. Bound to
trees near at hand were the three girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Boone, as he looked to his
rifle, &#8220;make your shots count; and above
all don&#8217;t allow any of them to get near the
girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the word, the whites rushed forward.
At the first crash among the underbrush
the savages grasped their weapons; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
long rifles cracked before they could act.
The conditions under which the &#8220;beads&#8221;
were drawn made the shots of the trailers
difficult; but in spite of this a number of
the Indians were hit; and all fled away
into the woods, leaving the greater part
of their arms and all of their ammunition
behind them.</p>

<p>There was the utmost rejoicing in
Boonesborough the next day when the
trailers returned bringing the three girls
with them, frightened, but safe and sound.</p>

<p>This incident served as a warning to the
settlers on the Kentucky; the war had
finally made its way to their lonely fort.
Day after day they found the tracks of
scouting parties all about in the forests;
hostile shots began to ring in the distance.
And then began the fights and
sieges for which the sturdy stockade built
by Boone and his companions became
famous. Encompassed many times by
hundreds of savages, with the arrows and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
bullets flying thick as hail about it, the fort
stood strong and untaken. And through it
all went Oliver and Eph Taylor and Sandy
Campbell, through it all went the heroic
Boone, ever leading, ever daring the wilderness
and its crafty savages, always strong
under reverses, always wise in victory.</p>

<p>And when the great war was done and
liberty was achieved by the colonies, the
settlers came in greatly increased numbers,
drawn by the wonder stories of Kentucky
and the magic name of Boone.</p>

<p>And as the commonwealth grows strong,
its wilderness falls before the axe of the
pioneer, its broad farms smile where the
Shawnee once roamed, the whistles of
steamboats sound upon the streams which
knew only the prow of the bark canoe, the
thoughts of its sons and daughters go back
to the old days; and they know that the
greatness of Kentucky is founded upon the
bold spirit and the long rifle of Daniel
Boone.</p>

<span class="small">SKETCH OF BOONE&#8217;S LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel Boone&#8217;s</span> ancestors were English,
his grandfather, George Boone, coming to
America in 1717. Squire Boone, son of
George, was the father of Daniel.</p>

<p>The Boones purchased a tract of land in
what is now Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
Squire Boone, Daniel&#8217;s father, married Sarah
Morgan; they had eleven children, Daniel
being the fourth and coming into the world
on July 14, 1732. This date is according
to the family record kept by his father&#8217;s
brother James, who was a schoolmaster.
Some of the biographies give different dates;
but it is likely that James Boone knew the
facts as well as any one.</p>

<p>The county of Bucks was then to all intents
a frontier settlement; the Boones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
lived in a log house; all about them were
the woods, which were running with game,
and in which hostile savages were often
seen.</p>

<p>Even in his school days, Daniel was
known as a hunter; his eye was of the
best and his rifle seldom failed. His passion
for the wilderness was shown in those
early times when he&#8217;d wander away in the
silent forest and be missing for days. Then
they would hunt for him and find him encamped
miles and miles away, perhaps
cooking his supper at a fire of sticks and
calmly planning the building of a hut
which was to shelter him for days to come.</p>

<p>A story is told of him which proves his
early skill as a hunter. With some other
lads of his own age, he started off for a day&#8217;s
hunting of small game. The shades of late
afternoon were deepening in the woods, and
the boys were on their way back to the
settlement when suddenly one of them
cried out: &#8220;Panther! Panther!&#8221; Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
of all the beasts of the forests, the lurking
panther was held to be the deadliest; and
knowing him for such, the boys ran for
their lives. But not so Boone. Steadily
he held his ground, his eye searching for
the animal. Yes, there it was; a panther
sure enough, and a big one. Calmly his
long rifle came to his shoulder and his
keen eyes drew the &#8220;bead.&#8221; And with
the ringing crack of the weapon, down fell
the panther, shot through and through.</p>

<p>Boone was still a boy when his father
concluded he&#8217;d get on better if he went to
North Carolina. He took up his homestead
on the Yadkin River; and in this
section Daniel grew to manhood, married
Rebecca Bryan, and became the father of
nine children.</p>

<p>During the whole of the dreadful Seven
Years&#8217; War, the whole frontier swarmed
with hostile redskins; but when this ended,
comparative quiet settled down, and Daniel
Boone made the first of his long excursions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
into the unknown country beyond the
Laurel Ridge or Cumberland Mountains.</p>

<p>The government of the colony of North
Carolina had long been oppressive; free
spirits like that of Boone could not stand
the gall of oppression, and the thought came
to him: &#8220;What a wonderful place to plant
a new settlement this new country would
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so when Colonel Henderson spoke
to him, as it is believed he did, Boone was
ready, and went upon his long exploration
of the country of &#8220;Cantuck,&#8221; as he called
it in one of his letters. Then followed the
events related in this story, which runs
very close to historical facts.</p>

<p>After the rescue of the Collaway girls
and Boone&#8217;s daughter from the Indians,
the savages came in force and attacked the
log fort; but they were driven off. A few
months later they returned with two hundred
braves in the band. For two days
and nights their attack was continued and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
at the end of that time they retreated once
more, defeated.</p>

<p>The impossibility of holding any communication
with the large settlements and
the stoppage of supplies caused the hardy
band at Boonesborough some suffering.
They ran entirely out of salt; and as this
was a thing which they must have, Boone
determined to procure a supply.</p>

<p>Taking thirty men, he proceeded cautiously
to Blue Licks with the intention of
making salt from the salt water to be found
in that section. While hunting and alone,
Boone fell in with a band of several hundred
Indians who were on their way to
make another attack upon Boonesborough.
They made him a prisoner, but following
their usual policy they did him no immediate
harm; holding him, possibly, for
future torture.</p>

<p>Craftily Boone began casting about for
the best thing to do; the Indians knew of
the presence of his men; to have this huge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
band fall upon the thirty might mean
death to them all. Boone concluded that
to surrender his command and trust to the
future was the best thing to be done. So
the band of whites gave up their arms, and
the Indians changed their plans as to
Boonesborough, proceeding instead to their
town of Chillicothe, on the Little Miami.</p>

<p>From here Boone and some of his men
were sent to Detroit, where Boone&#8217;s men
were turned over to the British. But the
savages had conceived such a liking for
Daniel himself that they refused to surrender
him, determining to adopt him into
their tribe. So they took him back to
Chillicothe and made him a son of the
Shawnee tribe.</p>

<p>Here he remained some months, being
treated by the Indians as one of themselves;
then a huge war party organized to march
upon Boonesborough and take it by surprise,
and Daniel saw that if the fort was to
be saved, he must escape at once. Slipping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
from the Indian town in the early morning,
Boone began a desperate journey toward
the fort, one hundred and sixty miles away.
It took him five days to make the journey,
and when he reached the fort he was hailed
as one returned from the dead. Indeed, so
sure were they that he was dead that his
family had returned to North Carolina.</p>

<p>Boone found the stockade in bad condition,
and at once set about strengthening
it. However, the great band did not move
against Boonesborough; the escape of the
great backwoodsman must have told them
that the settlers would be awaiting them,
and as they had had previous experiences of
this sort they set the attack for a future time.</p>

<p>In August, no enemy presenting himself,
Boone and a small party left the fort and
marched against an Indian village on the
Scioto. The braves belonging to this camp
were encountered in full war paint, some
distance from the town, and evidently on
the march to join some larger band. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
whites fell upon them and routed them,
though outnumbered two to one. Suspecting
that a large movement of the savages
was taking place, Boone sent out a couple
of scouts to get news. They soon returned
saying that these suspicions were correct;
and the frontiersmen hurried back toward
Boonesborough in all haste.</p>

<p>On the day after their arrival at the fort,
a great band of Indians, flying the British
colors and commanded by a French-Canadian
named Duquesne, made their appearance
out of the forest.</p>

<p>The fort was summoned to surrender, but
its defenders refused. They were sixty and
the savages were fully five hundred; but
they made up their minds to fight to the
last.</p>

<p>The Indians, directed by their most
famous chiefs, and now having the advantage
of Duquesne&#8217;s skilled military direction,
began their attack. Never was the
marksmanship of the Kentucky riflemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
more brilliant than it was in that battle.
Duquesne soon saw that he was the greatest
sufferer by this, as his Indians were falling
all around him; so he set about mining
under the river bank, meaning to blow up
the fort.</p>

<p>However, Boone discovered this and set
his men to countermining, flinging the
freshly dug earth over the walls of the fort.
The British leader saw by this that his plan
had failed, and abandoning it began an attack
as before.</p>

<p>This failed because of the unerring aim
of the settlers; and then the attackers became
besiegers, sitting down before the fort,
out of rifle range, meaning to starve it into
surrender. But in this he also failed; the
defenders had more food than the Indians;
and so, there being no way of feeding so
large a band in a protracted siege, Duquesne
gave up the attempt, and marched away,
leaving Boonesborough once more victorious.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>This was the last heavy blow aimed at
the historic stockade. In spite of the war,
emigrants poured into the new territory;
Boone brought back his family and set to
farming his acres like the others.</p>

<p>However, all during the affair with England,
Kentucky continued to merit the
name of &#8220;the dark and bloody ground.&#8221;
Fierce battles were frequent, and the farmer
tilled his hard won field with his long rifle
always ready at hand. And even after
peace had been declared, the Indians, under
their own chiefs and under the renegade,
Simon Girty, ranged the settled places and
strove to stem the tide of immigration. But
the whites were not to be denied; they
pressed on and on until the territory was
completely won.</p>

<p>Through a fault in the deeds and grants,
the settlements in the new country were
later thrown into disorder. Boone lost all
his land, and moved into Virginia with his
family, taking up his home on the Kanawha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
near to the place where the great battle
was fought in the Dunmore War. Later
he journeyed westward toward Missouri,
where he re&euml;stablished himself. As old
age and ill health came on, Boone applied
to Congress to recover his land; a part of
it was made over to him. His old age, and
he lived to be well on to ninety, was spent
roaming the woods with his rifle. He died
at the home of his son-in-law, Flanders
Collaway, some distance from the city of
St. Louis, in September, 1820.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
